## 10. Conclusions

This section presents a summary and conclusions for onsite areas and the offsite trail. Additionally, it describes the public involvement activities and next steps for PADEP's concurrence.

Onsite Areas: The Site has undergone environmental assessment activities since 2021, when the ASTs and associated piping were removed. Based on the results of previous AST closure soil sampling and subsequent delineation soil sampling for Act 2, concentrations of benzene, naphthalene, bis(2-chloroethyl)ether, biphenyl, lead, total chromium, and hexavalent chromium are greater than their respective PADEP Non-Residential Soil MSCs. Soil exceedances have been delineated onsite and soils containing COCs will be moved to a contained area during redevelopment activities. It is proposed that SSS will be used for these COCs, with pathway elimination consisting of an EC and engineering controls installed during redevelopment of the Site.

Groundwater sampling has identified benzene, naphthalene, filtered lead, filtered total chromium, and filtered hexavalent chromium at concentrations greater than the PADEP Non-Residential Used Aquifer Groundwater MSCs; these COCs will meet SSS. The concentrations of VOCs and lead have remained stable or have shown a decreasing trend throughout the quarterly monitoring program, and the detected concentrations in groundwater in the downgradient wells are less than their respective groundwater MSCs. The concentrations of all other COCs are less than the PADEP Non-Residential Used Aquifer Groundwater MSCs. Based on the sampling results over eight consecutive quarters, attainment in groundwater is demonstrated, except for the total and hexavalent chromium, which are still being sampled for in accordance with PADEP communications (Appendix A). Siterelated COCs are not expected to travel beyond the Site boundary or adjacent railroad at concentrations greater than their respective MSCs. Analytical results from surface water samples collected in the Schuylkill River confirm that COCs are not impacting surface water. It is proposed that SSS will be used for benzene, naphthalene, lead, and total and hexavalent chromium, with pathway elimination consisting of an EC. PADEP communications resulting from ecological screening confirm no open exposure pathways to ecological receptors.

Soil gas was evaluated through the comparison of soil, groundwater, and soil gas sampling results to the PADEP Non-Residential SHS VI SVs. In addition, soil gas sampling results were evaluated relative to 1/10 th the VI SVs for benzene and naphthalene because the SSS will be used to address these organic COCs. The evaluation identified benzene in sample SG-5 and non-detected MDLs at concentrations greater than the applicable VI SVs in SG-5, SG-6, and SG-7. As part of the warehouse construction during Site redevelopment, a passive SSDS will be installed as a proactive vapor intrusion mitigation measure to address concentrations greater than VI SVs beneath the building.

Bartram's Garden Mile Trail: Detections of hexavalent chromium are present in exceedance of the relevant Soil MSCs, Non-residential MSCs onsite and Residential MSCs along Bartram's Garden Mile Trail. Alliance remediated areas of Bartram's Garden Mile Trail receiving runoff from the Site drainage swale after discussion with PADEP, and post-remediation soil sampling results were primarily below the standards. Following the removal activities, the detections along the trail are not believed to be associated with historical Site operations, but rather with historical filling activities, the deposition of Schuylkill River sediments, as well as tidal influences from the river. Additional risk evaluations will be conducted, as agreed upon with PADEP, to evaluate hexavalent chromium at the specified locations along Bartram's Garden Mile Trail. The risk assessment will be submitted to PADEP under separate cover.

Public Involvement: The City of Philadelphia comments on the PIP were addressed, as practicable, in the February 2025 update to the PIP (Appendix B). A public meeting will be held following submittal of this RIR/Cleanup Plan. Other details of the PIP are presented in Section 1.2.
