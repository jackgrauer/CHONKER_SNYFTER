## Transcending False Nonprofit Governance Dilemmas

## J. Bart Morrison Assumption University

Demands for Broadened Accountability (BA) of nonprofit organizations require that boards achieve a high level  of  engagement  to  address  important  issues  properly  (Morrison  &amp;  Salipante,  2007).  This  paper presents  the  theoretical  basis  for  boards  falling  short  of  such  engagement  and  specifies  fundamental obstacles leaders face in achieving BA. One set of especially salient obstacles is conceptualized as false governance dilemmas. Two are considered in this paper: legitimacy vs. efficiency (Di Maggio &amp; Powell, 1983; Deephouse, 1996; Morrison &amp; Salipante, 2006) and conflict/monitoring vs. cooperation/collaboration. Two broadly defined relational practices - integrative bargaining (Walton &amp; McKersie, 1965) and maintenance of high-trust/high-distrust relationships (Lewicki, MacAllister, &amp; Bies, 1998)  -  are  presented  as  mechanisms  for  establishing  robust  board  engagement,  transcending  false governance  dilemmas  and  achieving  BA.  The  author  suggests  that  a  nonprofit  paradox  perspective (Cornforth, 2004) enables the gradual development of such practices, engagement, and accountability.

## INTRODUCTION

Boards  and  executives  of  nonprofit  organizations  are  responding  to  increased  public  stakeholder demands for Broadened Accountability (BA), where BA means going beyond the traditional rule-based forms of accountability to include the newer forms of negotiated-accountability (Morrison &amp; Salipante, 2007) Increasingly leaders recognize a need to account for more than the explicit, objective dimensions of an organization such as finances, formal planning, HR and legal affairs (Behn, 2001; Kearns, 1996). They must also account for the more-or-less implicit, subjective dimensions such as how well the mission is attained  and  to  what  degree  multiple  stakeholders  are  included  meaningfully.  Demands  for  Broadened Accountability of nonprofit organizations require that boards achieve a high level of engagement to address important issues properly. This paper offers a theoretical basis for boards falling short of such engagement, citing  as  cause  the  presumption  of  two  dilemmas:  legitimacy  vs  efficiency  and  conflict/monitoring  vs. cooperation/collaboration.  Refined  concepts  of  human  relationships  -  particularly  understandings  of managerial  agency  and  integrative  bargaining  and  the  simultaneity  of  trust  and  distrust  in  everyday relationships indicate the two dilemmas to be false. This paper posits a range of board practices which permit legitimacy and efficiency, and conflict/monitoring and cooperation/collaboration to be simultaneously  achieved  in  the  pursuit  of  Broadened  Accountability.  As  such,  the  paper  represents  an exploration of processes involved in the paradox model of nonprofit governance (Cornforth, 2004). The ability of boards and top-level managers to identify and tackle relational problems is argued to be a prime

requisite for boards to gradually evolve practices that support a level of engagement needed to transcend false dilemmas that impede the achievement Broadened Accountability.

## OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO ACHIEVING BA: TRANSCENDING FALSE DILEMMAS

## False Dilemma #1: Legitimacy vs. Efficiency

The  first  and  perhaps  most  important false  dilemma presumes  that  leaders  face  a  choice  between legitimacy vs. efficiency (Di Maggio &amp; Powell, 1983; Deephouse, 1996; Morrison &amp; Salipante, 2006), and the act of choosing one over the other erodes a board's capacity for engagement and achieving Broadened Accountability.

## Neoinstitutional Theory and the Nonprofit Sector

The  nonprofit  sector  is  heavily  institutionalized,  with  many  nonprofit  organizations  embedded  in relationships with a variety of other organizations that influence their destiny. The essence of institutional theory is that the survival of organizations is determined not only by their actual performance but also, and perhaps more strongly, by whether they are perceived by key social actors as legitimate and worthy of support. Consequently, according to the theory, organizations conform to practices that are perceived as signals  of  legitimacy,  producing  isomorphism  (Di  Maggio  &amp;  Powell,  1983;  Deephouse,  1996)  -  a homogeneity of practices across organizations in a particular institutionalized field.

There have been surprisingly few studies applying neoinstitutional theory to the problems of leading, managing  and  governing  nonprofit  organizations.  In  part,  this  is  due  to  the  sociological  approach  to institutional  theory  emphasizing  that  environmental  factors  determine  organizational  forms,  providing relatively little room for discretionary action on the part of managers (Zucker, 1987). It appears that the sociological approach has dominated in the nonprofit literature. Suchman (1995), however, points out the differing approach to institutional theory taken by scholars of organizational strategy. Contrary to standard interpretations of neoinstitutional theory in the nonprofit sector, Zucker and Suchman see significant need and possibility for managerial agency - that is, for action and decision-making by organizational leaders.

## The Need for Managerial Agency: Dangers in Conforming to Practices That Confer Legitimacy

Organizational  legitimacy  can  be  defined  as  a  general  perception  that  the  organization  is  acting appropriately,  that  it  is  meaningful  and  valuable,  given  a  set  of  values  and  beliefs  prevalent  in  the organization's field (Suchman, 1995). As such, and in keeping with resource dependency theory (Barney, 1991), legitimacy is argued to be critical to an organization's survival when this perception is held by actors such  as  foundations,  United  Ways,  and  governmental  units  that  control  resources  needed  by  the organization. These actors are in a position to coerce nonprofit organizations to adopt commonly favored practices, lest they lose their legitimacy. The legitimacy-efficiency dilemma posed above manifests itself in common but problematic understandings of best practices among nonprofit organizations, such as the efficacy of strategic planning (Mintzberg, 1994),  performance  metrics (Alexander, 1999), interorganizational collaboration, and policy governance. Key social actors treat these practices, and others, as indicators of an organization's legitimacy and can withhold resources from organizations that fail to display the practices. In addition to coercion, DiMaggio and Powell (1983) note two other sources of prescriptive pressure. One is that professions create normative expectations that their members will utilize accepted practices,  a  phenomenon  heightened  in  the  nonprofit  sector  by  the  professionalizing  of  nonprofit management. The second is mimicry, whereby organizational leaders attempting to cope with uncertainty mimic the actions taken by other organizations.

If  the  organizational  structures  and  processes  that  are  transmitted  through  coercive,  normative  and mimetic forces were truly effective in producing organizational performance, there would seem to be no dilemma  for  nonprofit  organizations.  However,  the  use  of  nonprofit  board  and  management  practices widely perceived as correct have been found to be largely unrelated to organizational effectiveness (Herman &amp; Renz, 2004). Indeed, Meyer &amp; Rowan (1977) have argued that any organizational attention to externally mandated ways of functioning is, per se , organizationally inefficient, in part due to the displacing of goals

(Selznick, 1949) and deflecting of resources. In addition, there are problems due to imperfections in the prescribed  practices.  A  fundamental  problem  is  that  the  value  of  an  innovative  practice  is  often  overestimated by its innovators and first proponents, with more realistic assessments of its value coming only after many years have passed and the practice has become taken-for-granted as effective. Such practices merit labels of myth and ceremony (Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977). They take on symbolic value among leaders in organizational circles as indicators of competent practice. Perhaps the most important long-term problem is that the loss of diversity in the case of extreme rigidification of an institutional field results in diminished societal  capacity to  respond  to  future  unknown  contingencies  (Scott  &amp; Meyer, 1994).  This  diminished capacity is especially poignant in the nonprofit sector where many missions are aimed at solving critical social problems that emerge from the unique conditions of a particular time and place, conditions that are difficult to foresee and may require novel organizational forms and practices.

## Balancing the Neo-institutional Dilemma: A Strategic Management Perspective &amp; Integrative Bargaining

The strategic management literature presumes that organizational leaders can choose from a range of actions in responding to external pressures and, hence, to the legitimacy-efficiency dilemma. One option for protecting organizational efficiency is decoupling (Meyer &amp; Rowan, 1977; Zucker, 1987; Weick, 1976), shielding internal activities that lie at the organization's technical core (Thompson, 1967) from activities involving external institutional actors. Decoupling can involve practices of concealing and buffering, noted in Christine Oliver's (1991) typology of managerial responses as avoidance . This response falls at a midpoint of possible responses that run from low to high managerial agency. Those that reflect low agency are acquiescence ,  with  managers  imitating  and  complying,  and compromise ,  with  managers  balancing  and compromising  between  external  and  internal  demands.  More  proactive  managerial  responses  involve escape from the field's pressures and manipulation , which can be achieved through co-opting or influencing external factors, such as creating new actors or legitimizing alternative beliefs (Suchman, 1995). Associated ways for managers to manipulate proactively their institutional environments include lobbying, restricting sanctioned membership in the organization's field to an elite group, and creating standards for the field (Bresser &amp; Millonig, 2003).

Typologies of responses that are based on low vs. high agency implicitly assume that an organization's managers must trade off compliance with environmental pressures against self-directed activities. However, the  concept  of  integrative  bargaining  (Walton  &amp;  McKersie,  1965)  suggests  otherwise.  One  party  in  a negotiation with others can pursue its own interests strongly while simultaneously attending to the interests of the other parties (Thomas, 1967). By doing so, it can move beyond compromise to a joint maximization process that frames the bargaining as collaborative problem solving capable of satisfying its own needs and those  of  other  stakeholders.  Similarly,  organizations  can  simultaneously  achieve  both  resource-based efficiency advantages and institutionally based legitimacy advantages by developing, respectively, their resource and institutional capital (Bresser &amp; Millonig, 2003).

## False Dilemma #2: Conflict and Monitoring vs. Cooperation and Collaboration

A  second  key  dilemma pits  conflict  and  monitoring  against  cooperation  and  collaboration.  Board member and executive leaders often falsely perceive a governance environment split between conflict and monitoring on one hand and cooperation and collaboration on the other. This bifurcated world undermines achievement of accountability and engagement.

## From One Dimensional Theories of Nonprofit Governance to a Paradox Perspective

Morgan (1986) argues that many of the leading theories that strive to explain organizational phenomena fail to encompass the full range of complex factors that make up the lived-lives of real actors within actual contexts. Complex, multi-factor organizational dynamics require multi-perspective approaches to manage inevitable  ambiguities,  dilemmas  and  tensions.  Moreover,  as  Cornforth  (2004)  points  out,  leaders  and scholars  have  recognized  for  some  time  that  important  problems  often  require  shifting  from  linear  to recursive thinking, from simple either/or choices to yes/and explorations of tensions and differences. This

line of thinking is applied to organizational governance in the nonprofit sector, especially when leaders confront three key operational tensions:

- 'The  tension  between  board  members  acting  as  representatives  for  particular  stakeholder groups and 'experts' charged with driving the performance of the organization forward;
- The  tension  between  the  board  roles  of  driving  forward  organizational  performance  and ensuring conformance i.e., that the organization behaves in an accountable and prudent manner; and,
- The tension between the contrasting board roles of controlling and supporting management.' (p.13)

These  three  tensions  can  be  subsumed  into  a  single  category.  Generally,  leaders  may  commonly perceive these tensions as two horns of a  single dilemma with conflict and monitoring on one tip and collaboration and cooperation on the other. Choosing one or the other may often seem to be the only way off the hook. Leaders may not perceive transcending this dilemma as an option.

Cornforth (2004) goes on to highlight several competing, well-established, one-dimensional theories or  paradigms  of  governance  including  agency  theory,  stakeholder  theory,  stewardship  theory,  resource dependency theory, and managerial hegemony theory. Each of these models tends to drive leaders to choose one  horn  of  the  dilemma  over  the  other  closing  off  pathways  to  engaging  with  both  dimensions simultaneously. Lewis (2000) discusses how taking a multi perspective approach serves as a 'sensitizing device' to the tensions between opposing models in respect to how each resolves key operational tensions. Different theories of governance produce different definitions of the role of the board and consequently lead to different unitary choices for how to resolve one or other of the key dilemmas. For example, agency theory naturally pushes leaders toward oppositional posturing and instrumental monitoring of agent/executives in favor of optimizing owners' interests. On the other hand, the partnership model favors cross-role collaboration and cooperation to optimize effectiveness at overall mission attainment often at the expense of efficient monitoring and auditing of agent/executive management. Cornforth suggests that a multi-paradigm  'paradox  approach'  that  is  informed  by  the  multiple  aforementioned theoretical perspectives can lead to a new synthetized conceptual framework of nonprofit governance - one that may possess the utility and power to manage the key tensions holistically rather than choosing one dimension over the other.

## Establishing a Paradox Perspective Through Simultaneous Trust and Distrust

Lewicki (1998) and Luhmann (1979) reframe a unitary concept of trust and distrust in a way that moves these concepts from a single continuum to two separate but linked ones. A traditional view of trust, distrust and relationships based on unidimensional thinking, balance, consistency and stasis is being replaced by a new one that embraces multidimensionality and paradox. Within the new view, it is not only possible but in some cases preferable, for parties to both trust and distrust one another - both monitor and cooperate given different experiences within the various distinct facets of complex multidimensional relationships. The possibility of possessing a dual capacity to embrace trust and distrust simultaneously suggests that leaders may be able to transcend the dilemma of conflict and monitoring vs. cooperation and collaboration.

Lewicki  (1998)  defines  trust  as  'confident  positive  expectations  regarding  another's  conduct'  and distrust as 'confident negative expectations regarding another's conduct.' Both concepts involve striving for certainty - in the case of trust, towards realizing one's hopes; and in the case of distrust, away from realizing one's fears. The traditional view of relationships places one's efforts to maximize hopes through trusting  and  to  minimize  fears  through  distrusting  on  a single  continuum .  It  is  as  if  hope/trust  and fear/distrust are different faces of a single coin, and that only one face may present at any given moment. Furthermore, the face of trust is always 'good' while the face of distrust is always 'bad.' A final assumption of  the  traditional  view  is  that  trust,  distrust  and  relationships  are unidimensional .  To  extend  the  coin metaphor, it is as if one may possess only a single coin, and that single coin carries the totality of the trust or distrust value for an entire relationship. Beyond the assumption that trust and distrust represent good and bad  parts  of  a  single  item  within  unidimensional  relationships,  the  traditional  view  emphasizes  the emergence and maintenance of balance and consistency .  Psychological imbalance and inconsistency in

respect to being ambivalent about trusting and distrusting is a negative condition. Individual as well as collective 'liking' and 'disliking', 'trusting' and 'distrusting' naturally should resolve to a single, stable point  that  is  distinctly  good  or  bad,  trusting  or  distrusting.  The  traditional  view  of  trust,  distrust  and relationships conjures the image of a solitary coin spinning until it settles in a more or less fixed state to display one unambiguous face or another - thus offering the actor certainty, stability and direction either to maximize hopes through trusting or to minimize fears through distrusting. According to the old view of relationships, to trust or to distrust seems to come down to a coin toss.

Lewicki  (1998)  makes  the  case  for  a  new  view  of  trust  and  distrust  that  takes  into  account  the complexity, uncertainty, plasticity, and paradox of human relationships. He draws on Luhmann's (1979) articulation of trust and distrust as functional equivalents but separate constructs. Both serve to reduce social complexity and uncertainty for rational actors - but each does so using different means. In the case of trust, uncertainty is reduced because possible undesirable conduct need not be considered while desirable conduct is considered certain. The opposite is true for distrust. Both trust and distrust simplify the world by focusing and narrowing expectations for either beneficial or negative conduct from the other.

Lewicki's formulation emphasizes that trust and distrust exist as two separate dimensions and:

For each dimension a quasi-stationary equilibrium of forces, composed of facets and bands within  bandwidth,  sustains  trust  or  distrust  at  specific  levels.  As  specific  facets  in  the relationship  change  (through  dialogue,  interaction,  joint  decision  making,  common experience, and so on), these changes tend to move the operational level of trust and distrust upward or downward (p.455).

A two-dimensional framework is built around these assumptions with trust on the vertical axis and distrust on the horizontal axis. Both dimensions are characterized as high or low. The framework produces four  prototypical  relationship  conditions:  (1)  low  trust/low  distrust,  (2)  high  trust/low  distrust,  (3)  low trust/high distrust, and (4) high trust/high distrust. Each condition is characterized by distinct relationship opportunities and challenges. For example, in high trust/low distrust (quadrant 3) relationships - the one that seems ideal from a traditional perspective - actors have high confidence in each other and no reason to suspect  each  other.  Opportunities  abound  and  partners  readily  pursue  common  aims.  Many  positive experiences  aggregate  and  solidify  through  reinforcing  feedback  loops.  Interdependence  expands  and widens. Appreciation, support and encouragement flourish. The trusting party is likely to identify with the values of the trusted creating intimacy, social capitol, shared risk taking and innovation. Parties are vigilant at interceding to restore trust when it is threatened. However, significant challenges emerge directly from these opportunities. All too often evidence of bad behavior and ill intent is judged suspect or rationalized away. Real threats are minimized or ignored in the name of preserving trust, which cuts off natural, useful, and necessary emergence of distrust. The capacity to address inevitable threats is diminished. Contrary to what might be expected and welcomed by one who holds a traditional view of trust and distrust, the potential for organizational dysfunction is significant when conditions are characterized by high trust/low distrust. Organizational complexity, role conflict, ambiguity, and the existence of greed and fear in human nature dictate that low distrust is a risky condition especially when paired with high trust. High trust/low distrust conditions inure actors to real threats especially from close partners. Lewicki suggests that the argument concerning the 'strength of week ties' (Granovetter, 1973) is instructive here. Granovetter notes that as the strength of relational ties ease, the possibility to establish and grow operational trust and distrust rises.

Unlike the condition of high trust/low distrust, the condition of high trust / high distrust the condition that seems ideal from a nontraditional multi-paradigm paradox perspective -produces opportunities for success in managing, coordinating, and governing complex organizations. Relationship partners may trust each other in certain respects and not trust each other in other respects. They may even distrust each other in  yet  other  respects.  A  multifaceted  approach  to  trust  and  distrust  represents  a  chosen  strategy  for minimizing expected undesired conduct and leveraging expected desired conduct. For example, in the case of nonprofit governance, trust (e.g., hope, faith, confidence, assurance, initiative) may define the facets of a relationship that effectively address issues of mission-based effectiveness and innovation, while distrust

(fear, skepticism, cynicism, watchfulness, vigilance) may define the facets of the same relationship that effectively address issues of resource efficiency, budgeting, auditing, etc.

Table 1 represents Lewicki, McAllister and Bies's integration of trust and distrust, and this author's interpretation of traditional vs. paradox perspectives. Each quadrant is a assigned a name that is intended to describe its nature. Quadrant 1, Passivity ,  represent Low Trust/Low Distrust. Quadrant 2, Pollyanna, represents high trust/low distrust. Quadrant 3, Terror , represents low trust/high distrust. Finally, Quadrant 4, Trust but Verify ,  represents high trust/ high distrust. Most telling is a comparison and contrast of the quadrants in respect to traditional and paradox perspectives. In this paper's interpretation the Pollyanna and Trust  but  Verify quadrants are in  clear  contradiction  in  respect  to  what  is  desirable  and  undesirable  in trust/distrust relationships, while the Passivity a nd Terror quadrants are aligned.

## CONCLUSION

The  concepts  described  in  this  paper  throw  light  on  how  leaders  can  go  beyond  balancing  false dilemmas to transcend them. In the case of the legitimacy vs. efficiency dilemma, leaders may engage in actions that respond simultaneously to external expectations and demands for organizational effectiveness through  relational  practices  such  as integrated  negotiation .  In  the  case  of  the  conflict/monitoring  vs cooperation/collaboration  dilemma,  leaders  may  engage  in  actions  that  manage  relationships  that  are trusting in some facets and distrusting in others.

This  paper represents  an  emerging  perspective  on  how  nonprofit  boards  can  achieve  authentic engagement to achieve broadened accountability, meaningful commitment and bold decision making. This paper  offers  an  initial  description  of  potential  pathways  to  establishing  a  multi-perspective  'paradox approach' by overcoming fundamental obstacles through radically reframing each. Fundamental to each of the reframing processes is the need for board member and executive leaders to establish and maintain unique and ever evolving relational practices between and among each other. In the case of the false dilemmas of legitimacy vs. efficiency as well as conflict and monitoring vs. cooperation and collaboration , it is possible to transcend an either/or proposition by reframing the classic view of governance from one based on roles, responsibilities and structures to one based on social competence (Bresser &amp; Millonig, 2003; Deephouse, 1996; Di Maggio &amp; Powell, 1983; Suchman, 1995).
