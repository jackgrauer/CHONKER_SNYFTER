<p>Chapter  11  Cases  have  been  consolidated  for  procedural  purposes  only  and  are  being  jointly administered under Bankruptcy Rule 1015.

No trustee or examiner has been appointed in these Chapter 11 Cases, nor has any statutory committee of unsecured creditors or equity security holders been appointed in these Chapter 11 Cases.</p>
<h2>E. Objections</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '5. ';">This Court takes judicial notice of the docket of these Chapter 11 Cases.

</ol>
<h2>F. Burden of Proof-Confirmation of the Plan</h2>

<li style="list-style-type: '6. ';">The Debtors, as Plan proponents, have met their burden of proving the applicable elements  of  sections  1129(a)  and  1129(b)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  by  a  preponderance  of  the evidence, which is the applicable evidentiary standard for Confirmation of the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>G. Notice</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '7.

The Publication Notice was published in The New York Times National Edition on December 18, 2023, in compliance with the Scheduling Order and Bankruptcy Rule 2002(l).  The Equity Notice was served through first class mail or e-mail to registered  and  nominee  holders  of  equity  securities,  as  well  as  applicable  transfer  agents  and securities  depositories  (with  instructions  to  serve  down  to  the  beneficial  holders  of  equity securities).

<h2>H. Adequacy of the Disclosure Statement</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '8. ';">The Disclosure Statement contains (a) sufficient information of a kind necessary to satisfy the disclosure requirements of all applicable non-bankruptcy laws, rules, and regulations (including the Securities Act), and (b) 'adequate information' (as such term is defined in section 1125(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and used in section 1126(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code), with respect  to  the  Debtors,  the  Plan,  and  the  transactions  contemplated  therein.    The  filing  of  the Disclosure Statement with the Clerk of the Court satisfied Bankruptcy Rule 3016(b).</li>
</ol>
<h2>I. Voting Report</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '9. ';">Only Holders of Claims in Class 4 (Prepetition Second Lien Claims) were eligible to vote on the Plan (the 'Voting Class').  The Ballots the Debtors used to solicit votes to accept or reject the Plan from Holders in the Voting Class adequately addressed the particular needs of these Chapter 11 Cases and were appropriate for Holders in the Voting Class to vote to accept or reject the Plan.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '10. ';">Holders of Claims or Interests in Classes 1, 2A, 2B, 3, 5, 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are Reinstated under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), and 7 (if the Intercompany Interests are Reinstated under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders) are Unimpaired under the Plan and, thus, are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan. Classes 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are cancelled under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 7 (if the Intercompany Interests are cancelled under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 8A, 8B, 8C and 9 are Impaired under the</li>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '11. ';">As set  forth  in  the  Voting  Declaration,  100%  in  number  of  Holders  of  Class  4 Claims together holding 100% in amount of Class 4 Claims voted to accept the Plan.  Thus, the Voting Class voted to accept the Plan in accordance with the requirements of sections 1124 and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>J. Solicitation</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '12. ';">The Solicitation Procedures, and the solicitation of votes on the Plan in accordance with the Solicitation Procedures, were appropriate and satisfactory based upon the circumstances of these Chapter 11 Cases, were conducted in good faith, complied with sections 1125 and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules 3017 and 3018, all other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, Local Rules, and all other applicable non-bankruptcy rules, laws, and regulations, and were conditionally approved by the Scheduling Order. The Solicitation Package, including the Ballot, (a) adequately addressed the particular needs of these Chapter 11 Cases; (b) was appropriate for Holders of Claims in Class 4 (Prepetition Second Lien Claims); and (c) complied with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Rules, and any other applicable rules, laws, and regulations (including the Securities Act).</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '13. ';">As  described  in  the  Voting  Declaration,  the  Scheduling  Motion,  the  Ventresca Declaration, and the Confirmation Brief, prior to the Petition Date, the Solicitation Packages were transmitted, distributed, and served to all Holders in the Voting Class that held a Claim against the Debtors as of December 8, 2023 (the 'Voting Record Date'), in compliance with sections 1125 and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules (including rules 3017 and 3018), the Local Rules, the Scheduling Order, all applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, Local Rules, and all other rules, laws, and regulations applicable to such solicitation.  The</li>
</ol>
<p>instructions in each Solicitation Package, including in the Ballot, adequately informed the Holders of Claim in the Voting Class of the deadline of December 18, 2020, at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) (the 'Voting Deadline') to submit completed Ballots and how to properly complete and submit the Ballots.  Additionally, prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors commenced the process of  soliciting  elections  for  participation  in  the  DIP  Facility  and  the  Exit  Facility  Backstop  by distributing Exit Facility Backstop subscription forms and instructions to all holders of Class 4 Claims  in  order  to  facilitate  their  participation  in  the  Restructuring  as  Exit  Facility  Backstop Parties.  The establishment and notice of the Voting Record Date were reasonable and sufficient, and the period during which the Debtors solicited votes to accept or reject the Plan provided a reasonable and sufficient period of time for Holders of Claims in the Voting Class to make an informed decision to accept or reject the Plan and participate in the DIP Facility and the Exit Facility.  No other or further notice or opportunity to vote on the Plan or participate in the DIP Facility or Exit Facility Backstop is or shall be required.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '14. ';">Under section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, Holders of Claims or Interests in Classes 1, 2A, 2B, 3, or 5 are Unimpaired under the Plan and, thus, are conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan.  The Holders of Claims in the Unimpaired Classes as of the Voting Record Date were served with a Combined Hearing Notice.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '15. ';">Holders of Claims in Class 6 (Intercompany Claims) and Holders of Interests in Class 7 (Intercompany Interests) are Unimpaired and conclusively deemed to accept the Plan (to the extent reinstated), or are Impaired and deemed to reject the Plan (to the extent cancelled), and, in either event, are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.  Each of the Holders in these classes is either a Debtor or Debtor affiliate.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '16. ';">Holders of Claims in Classes 8A (Existing Preferred Equity Interests), 8B (Existing Common Equity Interests), 8C (Existing PREIT Associates LP Interests), and 9 (Section 510(b) Claims)  are  Impaired  and  deemed  to  reject  the  Plan  but  were  nevertheless  served  with  the Combined Hearing Notice and the Equity Notice.  No other or further notice shall be required for such Holders.</li>
</ol>
<h2>K. Voting</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '17. ';">As evidenced by the Voting Declaration, votes to accept or reject the Plan (and elections  to  opt  out  of  the  Third-Party  Release)  have  been  solicited  and  tabulated  fairly  and accurately, in good faith, and in a manner consistent and in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code, the  Bankruptcy  Rules,  the  Local  Rules,  applicable  non-bankruptcy  laws,  and  the  Solicitation Procedures conditionally approved by this Court in the Scheduling Order.</li>
</ol>
<h2>L. Restructuring Support Agreement and Plan Supplement</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '18. ';">The Restructuring Support Agreement and the Plan Supplement comply with the Bankruptcy Code and the Plan, and the filing and notice of such documents are good, proper and in accordance with the Solicitation Procedures, the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, the Local Rules, and no other or further notice is required.  The Restructuring Support Agreement and all documents included in the Plan Supplement are an integral part of and incorporated by reference into the Plan and this Order.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '19. ';">The Debtors served the Plan Supplement on the Notice Parties.  No other or further notice is or shall be required.  To the extent that any modifications to the Plan Supplement, as filed with the Court prior to the Combined Hearing, are determined to be modifications to the Plan, in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 3019, any such modifications do not (a) constitute material modifications  of  the  Plan  under  section  1127  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  (b)  require  additional disclosure  under  section  1125  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  (c)  cause  the  Plan  to  fail  to  meet  the</li>

<p>requirements of section 1122 or 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, (d) materially and adversely change the treatment of any Claims or Existing Equity Interests, (e) require re-solicitation of any Holders of Claims or Interests, or (f) require that any such Holders be afforded an opportunity to change previously cast acceptances or rejections of the Plan.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '20. ';">Subject to the Plan and the Restructuring Support Agreement (including, for the avoidance  of  doubt,  any  consent  rights  set  forth  or  incorporated  therein),  and  only  consistent therewith, the Debtors' right to alter, amend, update, or modify, in each case in whole or in part, the Plan Supplement before the Effective Date is reserved.</li>
</ol>
<h2>M. Exit Facility</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '21. ';">The New Debt Documents, and each of the TL Exit Facility and Revolving Exit Facility to which they respectively relate, are, individually and collectively, essential elements of the Plan and reflect the Debtors' exercise of their business judgment consistent with their fiduciary duties, and entry into each of the New Debt Documents is in the best interests of the Debtors, their Estates, and  all Holders  of  Claims  and  Interests, and  is necessary  and  appropriate  for consummation of the Plan and the operations of the Reorganized Debtors.  The terms of the Exit Facility are fair, reasonable, and customary, and the Debtors provided adequate notice thereof. The parties to each of the New Debt Documents negotiated such New Debt Documents in good faith and at arm's-length, without the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the Debtors, and the New Debt Documents are supported by reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration. The  financial  accommodations  thereunder,  including  any  credit  extended  and  loans  made  or deemed made to the Reorganized Debtors, and any liens granted by the Reorganized Debtors, in each  case,  pursuant  to  the  applicable  New  Debt  Documents,  and  any  fees  paid  or  to  be  paid thereunder, are deemed to have been extended, issued, granted, and made or deemed made in good faith  and  for  legitimate  business  purposes,  shall  not  be  subject  to  recharacterization  for  any</li>

<p>purposes whatsoever, and shall not constitute preferential transfers, fraudulent conveyances or other avoidable transfers under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable non-bankruptcy law. The execution, delivery, or performance by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, of  any  documents  in  connection  with  the  Exit  Facility  and  compliance  by  the  Debtors  or  the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, with the terms thereof is authorized by, and does not conflict with, the terms of the Plan or this Order.  Each party to the New Debt Documents may rely upon the provisions of this Order in closing the Exit Facility.</p>
<h2>N. Compliance with Bankruptcy Code Requirements (Section 1129(a)(1))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '22. ';">As further described below, the Plan complies with all applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 1122 and 1123, thereby satisfying section 1129(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In addition, the Plan is dated and identifies the Entities submitting it, thereby satisfying Bankruptcy Rule 3016(a).  The filing of the Disclosure Statement satisfied Bankruptcy Rule 3016(b).</li>
</ol>
<h2>(i) Proper  Classification  of  Claims  and  Interests  (Sections  1122  and 1123(a)(1))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '23. ';">The  classification  of  Claims  and  Interests  under  the  Plan  is  proper  under  the Bankruptcy Code.  In accordance with sections 1122(a) and 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article III of the Plan provides for the separate classification of Claims and Interests into twelve Classes, based on differences in the legal nature or priority of such Claims and Interests (other than Administrative Claims, DIP Claims, Professional Fee Claims, and Priority Tax Claims, which are addressed in Article II of the Plan and which are not required to be designated as separate Classes pursuant to section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code).  Valid business, factual, and legal reasons exist for the separate classification of the various Classes of Claims and Interests created under the Plan.  The classifications were not promulgated for any improper purpose, and the creation of such</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 15 of 70</p>
<p>Classes  does  not  unfairly  discriminate  between  or  among  Holders  of  Claims  or  Interests.    In accordance  with  section  1122(a)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  each  Class  of  Claims  and  Interests contains only Claims or Interests that are substantially similar to the other Claims or Interests within that Class.  The Plan, therefore, satisfies sections 1122 and 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<h2>(ii) Specified Unimpaired Classes (Section 1123(a)(2))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '24. ';">Article III of the Plan specifies that Claims in Classes 1, 2A, 2B, 3, 5, 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are Reinstated under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT,  as  applicable,  with  the  consent  of  the  Requisite  Consenting  Lenders),  and  7  (if  the Intercompany Interests are Reinstated under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as  applicable,  with  the  consent  of  the  Requisite  Consenting  Lenders)  are  Unimpaired within the meaning of section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Plan, therefore, satisfies the requirements of section 1123(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '25. ';">Additionally, Article II of the Plan specifies that Allowed Administrative Claims, Professional Fee Claims, and Priority Tax Claims will be paid in full in accordance with the terms of the Plan, although these Claims are not separately classified under the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(iii) Specified Treatment of Impaired Classes (Section 1123(a)(3))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '26. ';">Article III of the Plan specifies that Classes 4, 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are cancelled under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 7 (if the Intercompany Interests are cancelled under  the  Plan,  as  determined  by  the  Debtors  or  Reorganized  PREIT,  as  applicable,  with  the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 8A, 8B, 8C, and 9 are Impaired under the Plan under section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code and details the treatment of such Classes.  The Plan, therefore, satisfies section 1123(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 16 of 70</p>
<h2>(iv) No Discrimination (Section 1123(a)(4))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '27. ';">Article III of the Plan provides the same treatment for each Claim or Interest within a particular class unless the Holder of a particular Claim or Interest has agreed to a less favorable treatment with respect to such Claim or Interest.  Furthermore, the consideration received by the Exit Facility Backstop Parties (including the Exit Facility Residual Backstop Parties) in connection with their respective commitments to fully backstop the Exit Facility is solely in exchange for such commitments and other good and valuable consideration and a necessary component of effecting the  Debtors'  Restructuring  Transactions,  and,  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt,  is  not  treatment  on account of any Claims or Interests held by such  Exit Facility Backstop Parties in violation of section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Plan, therefore, satisfies section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(v) Adequate Means for Plan Implementation (Section 1123(a)(5))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '28. ';">Article  IV  and  elsewhere  in  the  Plan  and  the  various  documents,  agreements, exhibits, and attachments to the Plan, the Plan Supplement, and the Disclosure Statement provide detailed, adequate, and proper means for the Plan's implementation including, but not limited to: (a)  the  general  settlement  of  Claims  and  Interests;  (b)  authorization  for  the  Debtors  and  the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, to take all actions necessary to effectuate the Plan, including those  actions  necessary  to  effect  the  Restructuring  Transactions,  the  Exit  Facility  Backstop Agreement,  the  Exit  Facility,  and  any  restructuring  transaction  steps  set  forth  in  the  Plan Supplement, as the same may be modified or amended (in accordance with the terms of the Plan, the Restructuring Support Agreement, and the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement, subject, in each case, to any consent rights set forth or incorporated therein) from time to time prior to the Effective Date; (c) the funding and sources of consideration for the Plan distributions, including the Exit Facility and the Debtors' Cash on hand; (d) the issuance of the New Common Stock (including on</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 17 of 70</p>
<p>account  of  the  Exit  Facility Backstop  Commitment  Premium);  (e)  the  adoption  of  the  New Governance Documents; (f) the continued corporate existence of the Debtors; (g) vesting of all property of each Estate and all Causes of Action in the Reorganized Debtors; (h) the cancellation, amendment, or amendment and restatement of prepetition agreements; (i) the authorization and approval  of  corporate  actions  under  the  Plan,  each  consistent  with  the  Restructuring  Support Agreement; (j) the appointment of the New Board; and (k) the effectuation and implementation of documents  and  further  transactions.    The  Plan,  therefore,  satisfies  section  1123(a)(5)  of  the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<h2>(vi) Non-Voting Equity Securities (Section 1123(a)(6))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '29. ';">Article  IV.M  of  the  Plan  provides  that  the  New  Governance  Documents  will prohibit the issuance of non-voting equity securities to the extent required under section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Thus, the Plan satisfies this provision.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(vii) Directors and Officers (Section 1123(a)(7))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '30. ';">The  Plan  satisfies  section  1123(a)(7)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code.    The  Plan Supplement sets forth the identities of all currently known directors for the initial term of the New Board, consistent with the interests of all Holders of Claims and Interests and public policy.  The initial members of the New Board will be designated and appointed in accordance with the New Governance Documents.  In subsequent terms, the directors will be selected in accordance with the New Governance Documents. Provisions regarding the removal, appointment and replacement of members of the New Board will be set forth in the New Governance Documents.  Each director and officer of the Reorganized Debtors shall serve from and after the Effective Date pursuant to the applicable New Governance Documents and other constituent documents.  Accordingly, the Plan satisfies section 1123(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>

<h2>O. Additional Plan Provisions (Section 1123(b))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '31. ';">As set forth below, the discretionary provisions of the Plan comply with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and are not inconsistent with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  Thus, section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code is satisfied.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(i) Impaired/Unimpaired Classes (Section 1123(b)(1))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '32. ';">The Plan complies with section 1123(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Under Article III of the Plan, Classes 1, 2A, 2B, 3, 5, 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are Reinstated under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), and 7 (if the Intercompany Interests are Reinstated under the Plan, as  determined  by  the  Debtors  or  Reorganized  PREIT,  as  applicable,  with  the  consent  of  the Requisite Consenting Lenders) are Unimpaired, and Classes 4, 6 (if the Intercompany Claims are cancelled under the Plan, as determined by the Debtors or Reorganized PREIT, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 7 (if the Intercompany Interests are cancelled under  the  Plan,  as  determined  by  the  Debtors  or  Reorganized  PREIT,  as  applicable,  with  the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders), 8A, 8B, 8C, and 9 are Impaired.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(ii) Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases (Section 1123(b)(2))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '33. ';">The Plan complies with section 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Article V of the Plan provides that, on the Effective Date, except as otherwise provided in the Plan or in any contract, instrument, release, indenture, or other agreement or document entered into in connection with the Plan, each of the Debtors' Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases shall be deemed assumed (or assumed and assigned to the respective Reorganized Debtor, as applicable) as of the Effective Date, without the need for any further notice to or action, or separate order or approval of  this  Court,  unless  such  Executory  Contract  or  Unexpired  Lease:  (i)  previously  expired  or</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 19 of 70</p>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '34. ';">The Debtors provided sufficient notice and an opportunity to object and be heard to each non-Debtor counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to be assumed, assumed and assigned, or rejected, as applicable, by the Debtors under the Plan, and no other or further notice was or shall be required.</li>
</ol>
<h2>(iii) Settlement, Releases, Exculpation, Injunction, and Preservation of Claims and Causes of Action (Section 1123(b)(3))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '35. ';">The Plan complies with section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9019, solely as to the signatories to the Restructuring Support Agreement, in  consideration  for  the  classification,  settlement,  distributions,  releases,  and  other  benefits provided under the Plan, on the Effective Date, the provisions of the Plan shall constitute a good faith compromise and settlement of all such Claims, Interests, and Causes of Action in the Impaired Classes and controversies relating to the contractual, legal, and subordination rights that a Holder of an Impaired Claim or Interest may have with respect to any Allowed Claim or Interest, or any distribution to be made or treatment provided on account of such Allowed Claim or Interest, as set forth in the Restructuring Support Agreement and as between the Consenting Lenders and the Debtors.  The  entry  of  this  Order  shall  constitute  the  Bankruptcy  Court's  approval  of  such compromise and settlement, as well as a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that such settlement and compromise is fair, equitable, reasonable, and in the best interests of the Debtors and their Estates. Subject to Article VI of the Plan, all distributions made to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests (as applicable) in any Class are intended to be and shall be final.</li>

';">In  accordance  with  the  Plan,  without  any  further  notice  to  or  action,  order  or approval  of  the  Bankruptcy  Court,  after  the  Effective  Date,  the  Reorganized  Debtors  may compromise and settle Claims against the Debtors and their Estates and Causes of Action against other Entities.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '37. ';">The entry of this Order shall constitute this Court's approval of the compromise or settlement of all Claims and Interests in the Impaired Classes and controversies and a finding by the Bankruptcy Court that such compromise or settlement is in the best interests of the Debtors, their Estates, and Holders of Claims and Interests and is fair, equitable and reasonable.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '38. ';">Article  VIII.A  of  the  Plan  provides  for  the  discharge  of  Claims  against  and terminated Interests in the Debtors (the 'Discharge'); Article VIII.B provides for the release of certain Liens against the Debtors and property of their Estates (the 'Lien Release'); Article VIII.C provides for the release  of  the  Released  Parties  by  the  Debtors  and  their  Estates  (the  'Debtor Release'); Article VIII.D provides for the release of the Released Parties by the Releasing Parties (the 'Third-Party Release'); Article VIII.E provides for exculpation of the Exculpated Parties (the 'Exculpation'); and Article VIII.F provides for an injunction (the 'Injunction'), in each case as set forth in the Plan.  These provisions were fully and conspicuously disclosed to all parties in interest in the Ballot, the Combined Hearing Notice, the Publication Notice and the Equity Notice, each of which excerpted the full text of the release, exculpation, and injunction provisions as set forth in the Plan and, in the case of the Third-Party Release, such provisions (as modified by this Order) are fully consensual.  The Court has jurisdiction under sections 1334(a)-(b) of the Judicial Code and authority under section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code to approve each of the Discharge, the Lien Release, the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release, the Exculpation, and the Injunction.</li>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '39. ';">As  has  been  established  based  upon  the  evidence  presented  at  the  Combined Hearing,  the  Discharge,  the  Lien  Release,  the  Debtor  Release,  the  Third-Party  Release,  the Exculpation,  and  the  Injunction  (a)  were  given  in  exchange  for  good,  valuable,  and  adequate consideration after due notice and opportunity for hearing, (b) are appropriately tailored under the facts  and  circumstances  of  these  Chapter  11  Cases,  (c)  were  integral  to  the  agreements  and settlements  among  the  various  parties  in  interest  and  are  essential  to  the  formulation  and implementation  of  the  Plan,  as  provided  in  section  1123  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  (d)  confer substantial benefits on the Estates, (e) are fair, equitable, and reasonable, and (f) are in the best interests of the Debtors, the Estates, and parties in interest.  Further, the failure to implement the Discharge, the Lien Release, the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release, the Exculpation, and the Injunction would impair the Debtors' ability to confirm and implement the Plan.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '40. ';">Releases .  Based on the record established at the Combined Hearing and as set forth in the Confirmation Brief and the Ventresca Declaration, the Debtor Release represents a valid exercise of the Debtors' business judgment, is fair, equitable and reasonable, necessary to the Plan and in the best interest  of  the  Debtors'  estates,  thereby  satisfying  applicable  case  law.      Such releases are given in exchange for and are supported by fair, sufficient and adequate consideration provided to each and all of the parties providing such release.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '41. ';">Based on the record established at the Combined Hearing and as set forth in the Confirmation Brief and the Ventresca Declaration, the Third-Party Release (as modified by this Order) is consensual with respect to the Releasing Parties because the releases therein are provided by parties who voted in favor of the Plan and had an opportunity to affirmatively opt out of the Third-Party Release on the Ballot but did not to choose to opt out of the Third-Party Release.</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 22 of 70</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '42. ';">Exculpation .    The  Exculpation  appropriately  affords  protection  to  those  parties who constructively participated in and contributed to the Debtors' chapter 11 process consistent with their duties under the Bankruptcy Code and is appropriately tailored to protect the Exculpated Parties from inappropriate litigation.  The Exculpation granted under the Plan is reasonable in scope as it does not relieve any party of liability for an act or omission to the extent such act or omission  is  determined  by  final  order  to  constitute  actual  fraud,  willful  misconduct,  or  gross negligence.  The Exculpation, including its carve-out for actual fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, is consistent with established practice in this jurisdiction.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '43. ';">Injunction. The Injunction is essential to implement the Plan and to preserve and enforce  the  Debtor  Release,  the  Lien  Release,  the  Third-Party  Release,  the  Exculpation,  and discharge provisions set forth in Article VIII of the Plan.  The Injunction is appropriately tailored to achieve those purposes.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '44. ';">Accordingly, based upon the record of these Chapter 11 Cases, the representations of the parties and the evidence proffered, adduced, or presented at the Combined Hearing, the Discharge, the Lien Release, the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release, the Exculpation, and the Injunction set forth in Article VIII of the Plan are consistent with the Bankruptcy Code and applicable law.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '45. ';">Release of Liens. The Release of Liens described in Article VIII.B of the Plan is necessary to implement the Plan.  The provisions of the Release of Liens are appropriate, fair, equitable, and reasonable, and are in the best interests of the Debtors, the Estates, and Holders of Claims and Interests.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '46. ';">Causes of Action. In accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, but subject to Article VIII of the Plan, each Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall retain and</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 23 of 70</p>
<p>may enforce all rights to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all Causes of Action of the Debtors, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, including any actions specifically enumerated in the Schedule of Retained Causes of Action, and the Reorganized Debtors' rights to commence, prosecute,  or  settle  such  Causes  of  Action  shall  be  preserved  notwithstanding  the occurrence of the Effective Date.  Causes of Action released by the Debtors pursuant to the releases and exculpations contained in the Plan, including in Article VIII of the Plan, shall be deemed released and waived by the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors as of the Effective Date. The provisions regarding the preservation of Causes of Action in the Plan (including in Article IV.T) and  the  Plan  Supplement,  are  appropriate,  fair,  equitable,  and  reasonable,  and  are  in  the  best interests of the Debtors, the Estates, and Holders of Claims and Interests.</p>
<h2>(iv) Additional Plan Provisions (Section 1123(b)(6))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '47. ';">The Plan contains certain other provisions that may be construed as permissive but are not required for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code.  These discretionary provisions of the Plan are appropriate and consistent with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, thereby satisfying section 1123(b)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>P. Debtors' Compliance with the Bankruptcy Code (Section 1129(a)(2))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '48. ';">As  further  described  below,  the  Debtors  have  complied  with  the  applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and, thus, satisfy the requirements of section 1129(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Specifically, each Debtor:</li>
<li style="list-style-type: 'a. ';">is an eligible debtor under section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code and a proper proponent of the Plan under section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: 'b. ';">has complied with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise provided or permitted by orders of the Court; and</li>
<li style="list-style-type: 'c. ';">complied with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including sections  1125  and  1126,  the  Bankruptcy  Rules,  the  Local  Rules,  any applicable non-bankruptcy law, rule, or regulation, the Scheduling Order,</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 24 of 70</p>
<p>and all other applicable law, in transmitting the Solicitation Package, the Backstop subscription forms and instructions, and related documents and notices, and in soliciting and tabulating the votes (and the opt-out elections) on  the  Plan  and  in  effectuating  the  Exit  Facility  Backstop  Agreement subscription process.</p>
<h2>Q. Plan Proposed in Good Faith (Section 1129(a)(3))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '49. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.  In so determining, the Court has examined the totality of the circumstances surrounding the filing of these Chapter 11 Cases, the Plan, the Restructuring Support Agreement, the process leading to confirmation, including the overwhelming support for the Plan, and the transactions to be implemented pursuant thereto.  The Plan and the Restructuring Transactions are the product of arm's-length negotiations by and among the Debtors and the Consenting Lenders, aimed at best positioning the Debtors for long-term growth and success.  This comports with one of the principal purposes of chapter 11: to enable a distressed entity to reorganize its affairs, prevent job losses, and stave off the adverse economic effects associated with disposing of assets at liquidation value.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '50. ';">The Debtors commenced these Chapter 11 Cases and proposed the Plan with the legitimate and honest purpose of maximizing the value of the Debtors' assets and maximizing distributions and/or recoveries to all stakeholders.  Additionally, the Plan has been proposed in compliance with applicable law, rules and regulations.  The Plan was conceived and proposed with the  'honest  purpose'  and  'reasonable  hope  of  success'  by  which  'good  faith'  under  section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code is measured. See In re Sun Country Dev., Inc. , 764 F.2d 406, 408 (5th Cir. 1985).  Accordingly, the Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1129(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Based on the foregoing and the record of these Chapter 11 Cases, including, but  not  limited  to,  the  Restructuring  Support  Agreement,  the  Combined  Hearing,  the  Mates Declaration,  the  Ventresca  Declaration,  and  the  unanimous  support  of  the  Holders  of  Claims</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 25 of 70</p>
<p>entitled  to  vote  on  the  Plan,  the  Plan  has  been  proposed  in  good  faith  and  not  by  any  means forbidden by law.</p>
<h2>R. Payment for Services or Costs and Expenses (Section 1129(a)(4))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '51. ';">The  procedures  set  forth  in  the  Plan  for  the  Court's  review  and  ultimate determination of the fees and expenses to be paid by the Debtors in connection with these Chapter 11  Cases,  or  in  connection  with  the  Plan  and  incident  to  these  Chapter  11  Cases,  satisfy  the objectives of, and comply with, section 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Court retains jurisdiction  to  hear  and  determine  all  applications  for  Professional  Fee  Claims  incurred  on  or before the Effective Date.</li>
</ol>
<h2>S. Directors, Officers, and Insiders (Section 1129(a)(5))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '52. ';">The Debtors have satisfied section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Section 1129(a)(5) requires that the appointment of an individual to serve as 'a director, officer, or voting trustee of the debtor' be identified and be 'consistent with the interests of creditors and equity security holders and with public policy.' 11 U.S.C. ¬ß 1129(a)(5)(A)(ii).  The Debtors have made these necessary disclosures in the Plan Supplement, and the Plan thus satisfies section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>T. No Rate Changes (Section 1129(a)(6))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '53. ';">Section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is not applicable to these Chapter 11 Cases.  The Plan does not provide for any rate change that requires regulatory approval.</li>
</ol>
<h2>U. Best Interest of Creditors (Section 1129(a)(7))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '54. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Each Holder of a Claim or Interest either (a) has voted to accept the Plan, (b) is Unimpaired and deemed to have accepted the Plan, or (c) shall receive or retain under the Plan, on account of such Claim or Interest, property of a value, as of the Effective Date of the Plan, that is not less than the amount that such</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 26 of 70</p>
<p>Holder  would  receive  or  retain  if  the  Debtors  were  to  be  liquidated  under  chapter  7  of  the Bankruptcy Code on such date.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '55. ';">In  addition,  the  liquidation  analysis  attached  as  Exhibit  E  to  the  Disclosure Statement, as well as the other evidence related thereto in support of the Plan that was proffered or adduced in the Mates Declaration, or at, prior to, or in connection with the Combined Hearing: (a) is reasonable, persuasive, credible, and accurate as of the dates such analysis or evidence was prepared,  presented,  or  proffered;  (b)  utilizes  reasonable  and  appropriate  methodologies  and assumptions; (c) has not been controverted by any other evidence; and (d) establishes that each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest in each Class will recover at least as much under the Plan on account of such Claim or Interest, as of the Effective Date, as such Holder would receive if the Debtors were liquidated, on the Effective Date, under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<h2>V. Acceptance by Certain Classes (Section 1129(a)(8))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '56. ';">The Impaired Non-Voting Classes are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan, and therefore the Plan does not satisfy section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code.  However, the  Plan  is  confirmable  under  section  1129(a)(10)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  because  Class 4 unanimously  voted  to  accept  the  Plan  and,  with  respect  to  the  Impaired  Non-Voting  Classes, section 1129(b) is satisfied as set forth below.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: 'W. ';">Treatment  of  Claims  Entitled  to  Priority  Under  Section  507(a)  of  the Bankruptcy Code (Section 1129(a)(9))</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '57. ';">The  Plan's  treatment  of  Administrative  Claims  (including,  but  not  limited  to, Professional Fee Claims) and Priority Tax Claims pursuant to Article II of the Plan satisfies the requirements of, and complies in all respects with, sections 1129(a)(9)(A), (C), and (D) of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable.  The treatment of Other Priority Claims under Article III of the Plan satisfies the requirements of, and complies in all respects with, section 1129(a)(9)(B) of the</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 27 of 70</p>
<p>Bankruptcy  Code.    The  Debtors  have  sufficient  Cash  to  pay  Allowed  Administrative  Claims, Priority Tax Claims, and Other Priority Claims.</p>
<h2>X. Acceptance by at Least One Impaired Class (Section 1129(a)(10))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '58. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Class 4 (Prepetition Second Lien Claims) voted to accept the Plan by the requisite number of Holders of Claims and the requisite amount of Claims, without including any acceptance of the Plan by any insider (as that term is defined in section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Y. Feasibility (Section 1129(a)(11))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '59. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code.  As reflected in the financial projections attached as Exhibit D  to the Disclosure  Statement  (the 'Financial Projections')  and  described  in  the  Mates  Declaration  and  the  other  evidence  supporting Confirmation of the Plan preferred or adduced by the Debtors at, or prior to, the Combined hearing, the Reorganized Debtors will have sufficient liquidity to honor their obligations under the Plan and to fund their business operations after Confirmation of the Plan without the need for liquidation or further financial reorganization.  The Financial Projections and the other evidence supporting Confirmation of the Plan proffered or  adduced  by the Debtors at, or prior to, or in the Mates Declaration filed in connection with, the Combined Hearing: (a) are reasonable, persuasive, and credible as of the dates such analysis or evidence was prepared, presented, or proffered; (b) utilize reasonable and appropriate methodologies and assumptions; (c) have not been controverted by other evidence; (d) establish that the Plan is feasible and Confirmation of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation or the need for further financial reorganization of the Reorganized Debtors or any successor to the Reorganized Debtors under the Plan, except as provided in the Plan; and (e) establish that the Reorganized Debtors shall have sufficient liquidity and be able to meet their financial obligations under the Plan and in the ordinary course of their businesses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 28 of 70</p>
<h2>Z. Payment of Fees (Section 1129(a)(12))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '60. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(12) of the Bankruptcy Code.  All fees due and payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1930 ('Quarterly Fees') prior to the Effective Date shall be paid by the Debtors on the Effective Date.  After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall be jointly and severally liable to pay any and all Quarterly Fees when due and payable. After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall file with the Bankruptcy Court separate UST Form 11-PCR reports when they become due. Each and every one of the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors shall remain obligated to pay Quarterly Fees to the Office of the U.S. Trustee until that particular Debtor's Chapter 11 Case is converted to a case under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, dismissed, or closed, whichever occurs first. The U.S. Trustee shall not be required to file any Administrative Claim in these Chapter 11 Cases and shall not be treated as providing any release under the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>AA. Continuation of Retiree Benefits (Section 1129(a)(13))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '61. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Article V.G of the Plan provides that, from and after the Effective Date, all retiree benefits (as such term is defined in section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code), if any, shall be paid in accordance with applicable law.</li>
</ol>
<h2>BB. Non-Applicability of Certain Sections (Sections 1129(a)(14), (15), and (16))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '62. ';">Sections 1129(a)(14), 1129(a)(15), and 1129(a)(16) of the Bankruptcy Code do not apply to these Chapter 11 Cases.  The Debtors do not owe any domestic support obligations, are not individuals, and are not non-profit corporations.</li>
</ol>
<h2>CC. 'Cram Down' Requirements (Section 1129(b))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '63. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Impaired Non-Voting Classes have been deemed to reject the Plan, the Plan may be confirmed pursuant to section 1129(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code since Impaired Class 4 voted</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 29 of 70</p>
<p>to accept the Plan.  First, all of the requirements of section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code other than section 1129(a)(8) have been met.  Second, the Plan is fair and equitable with respect to the Impaired Non-Voting Classes.  The Plan has been proposed in good faith, is reasonable, and meets the requirements that (a) no holder of any Claim or Interest that is junior to each Impaired NonVoting Class will receive or retain any property from the Debtors under the Plan on account of such junior Claim or Interest in violation of the absolute priority rule and (b) no holder of a Claim in a Class senior to such Class is receiving more than 100% on account of its Claim. Accordingly, the Plan is fair and equitable to all holders of Claims and Interests in the Impaired Non-Voting Classes.  Third, the Plan does not discriminate unfairly with respect to the Impaired Non-Voting Classes because similarly situated creditors and interest holders will receive substantially similar treatment on account of their Claims and Interests.  The Plan may therefore be confirmed despite the fact that not all Impaired Classes have voted to accept the Plan.</p>
<h2>DD. Only One Plan (Section 1129(c))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '64. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(c) of the Bankruptcy Code as the Plan is the only chapter 11 plan filed in each of these Chapter 11 Cases.</li>
</ol>
<h2>EE. Principal Purpose of the Plan (Section 1129(d))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '65. ';">The Plan satisfies section 1129(d) of the Bankruptcy Code as the principal purpose of the Plan is not the avoidance of taxes or the avoidance of the application of Section 5 of the Securities Act.  No Governmental Unit has requested that the Court not confirm the Plan on such grounds.</li>
</ol>
<h2>FF. Not Small Business Cases (Section 1129(e))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '66. ';">Section 1129(e) of the Bankruptcy Code does not apply to these Chapter 11 Cases as  none  of  these  Chapter  11  Cases  are  a  'small  business  case,'  as  that  term  is  defined  in  the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 30 of 70</p>
<h2>GG. Good Faith Solicitation (Section 1125(e))</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '67. ';">The  Debtors  and  their  agents  solicited  and  tabulated  votes  on  the  Plan  and participated in the activities described in section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code fairly, in good faith within the meaning of section 1125(e), and in a manner consistent with the Disclosure Statement, the Scheduling Order, the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and all other applicable rules, laws, and regulations.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '68. ';">The Debtors and their agents participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable  provisions  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  with  regard  to  the  offering,  issuance,  and distribution of recoveries under the Plan and therefore are not, and on account of such distributions will not be, liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or distributions made pursuant to the Plan, so long as such distributions are made consistent with and pursuant to the Plan.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '69. ';">The  Debtors  participated  in  good  faith  and  in  compliance  with  the  applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code in the offer, issuance, sale, solicitation, and/or purchase of the securities offered under the Plan (if any participation was made) and the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '70. ';">Based on the foregoing, the Debtors and their agents are entitled to the protections afforded by section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code and the Exculpation provisions set forth in Article VIII.E of the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>HH. Satisfaction of Confirmation Requirements</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '71. ';">Based  on  the  foregoing,  all  other  pleadings,  documents,  exhibits,  statements, declarations, and affidavits filed in connection with Confirmation of the Plan and all evidence and arguments  made,  proffered  or  adduced  at  the  Combined  Hearing,  the  Plan  satisfies  the requirements for confirmation set forth in section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 31 of 70</p>
<h2>II. Likelihood of Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent to the Effective Date</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '72. ';">Each condition precedent to the Effective Date set forth in Article IX.A of the Plan has been or is reasonably likely to be satisfied or waived in accordance with Article IX.B of the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>JJ. Implementation</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '73. ';">All documents necessary to implement the Plan and all other relevant and necessary documents,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  the  documents  contained  in  the  Plan  Supplement (including the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement and the New Debt Documents), are essential elements of the Plan, and entry into and consummation of the transactions contemplated by each such  document  and  agreement  (including  the  transactions  set  forth  in  the  Restructuring Transactions Memorandum) is in the best interests of the Debtors and their Estates, and shall, upon completion of documentation and execution and delivery, be valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and conditions.  The Debtors have exercised reasonable business judgment in determining to enter into these documents and the documents have been negotiated  in  good  faith  and  at  arm's  length.    The  Debtors  and  the  Reorganized  Debtors,  as applicable, are authorized, without any further notice to or action, order or approval of the Court, to finalize, execute, and deliver all agreements, documents, instruments, and certificates relating thereto and perform their obligations thereunder in accordance with the Plan.</li>
</ol>
<h2>KK. [Omitted]</h2>
<h2>LL. Good Faith</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '74. ';">The Debtors, the Released Parties, the Exculpated Parties, and the Related Parties of each of the foregoing, as applicable, have acted in 'good faith' within the meaning of section 1125(e)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  and  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  provisions  of  the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules, and the Local Rules in connection with all of their respective</li>
</ol>
<p>Case 23-11974-KBO    Doc 193    Filed 01/23/24    Page 32 of 70</p>
<p>activities  relating  to  support  of  the  Plan  and  this  Order,  including  the  execution,  delivery,  and performance of the Restructuring Support Agreement and New Debt Documents (including the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement), their participation in these Chapter 11 Cases, and the activities described in section 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code, and are entitled to the protections afforded by section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '75. ';">The Debtors proposed the Plan in good faith and not by any means prohibited by law, with the legitimate and honest purpose of maximizing the value of the Debtors' Estates for the  benefit  of  their  stakeholders.  The  Plan  accomplishes  this  goal.  The  Plan  is  the  product  of extensive, good  faith, arm's-length negotiations among  the Debtors and their principal constituencies. Accordingly, the Debtors, the Released Parties, and the Exculpated Parties have been, are, and will continue to be acting in good faith within the meaning of section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code if they proceed to: (a) consummate the Plan, the Restructuring Transactions, the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement, the New Debt Documents, and the agreements, settlements, transactions,  transfers,  and  other  actions  contemplated  thereby,  regardless  of  whether  such agreements, settlements, transactions, transfers, and other actions are expressly authorized by this Order; and (b) take any actions authorized and directed or contemplated by this Order.</li>

To the extent provided in the New Debt Documents, the New Agent is authorized to file with the appropriate authorities mortgages, financing statements and other documents, and to take any other action in order to evidence, validate, and perfect  such  Liens  or  security  interests  (it  being  understood  that  none  of  the  foregoing  shall  be necessary to give such effect given the preceding sentence and the automatic perfection provided thereunder).  The priorities of such Liens and security interests shall be as set forth in the New Debt</p>
<p>Documents.  The New Agent shall be authorized to make all filings and recordings that the New Agent  deems  appropriate  to  give  notice  of  the  establishment  and  perfection  of  such  Liens  and security interests under the provisions of the applicable state, federal, or other law, in each case, that would be applicable in the absence of the Plan and the Confirmation Order (it being understood that the grant, validity, binding nature and perfection shall occur automatically by virtue of the entry of the  Confirmation  Order  and  any  such  filings,  recordings,  approvals,  and  consents  shall  not  be required and the filing of any such filings, recording approvals, and consents, even if defective, shall not  undermine  or  invalidate  the  first  sentence  of  this  paragraph  and  the  automatic  perfection thereunder), and will thereafter cooperate to make all other filings and recordings that otherwise would be necessary under applicable law in the absence of the Plan and the Confirmation Order to give notice of such Liens and security interests to third parties.  The guaranties granted under the New Debt Documents have been granted in good faith, for legitimate business purposes, and for reasonably equivalent value as an inducement to the lenders thereunder to extend credit thereunder and shall be deemed to not constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer and shall not otherwise be subject to avoidance, recharacterization, or subordination for any purposes whatsoever and shall not constitute preferential transfers or fraudulent conveyances under the Bankruptcy Code or any applicable non-bankruptcy law.</p>

The TL Exit Facility Funding Premium and the Revolving Exit Facility Upfront Payment will be fully earned, due and payable on the Effective Date.</p>

<p>In accordance with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, but subject to Article VIII hereof,  each  Reorganized  Debtor,  as  applicable,  shall  retain  and  may  enforce  all  rights  to commence and pursue, as appropriate, any and all Causes of Action of the Debtors, whether arising before or after the Petition Date, including any actions specifically enumerated in the Schedule of Retained Causes of Action, and the Reorganized Debtors' rights to commence, prosecute, or settle such Causes of Action shall be preserved notwithstanding the occurrence of the Effective Date.</p>
<p>Causes of Action released by the Debtors pursuant to the releases and exculpations contained in the Plan, including in Article VIII hereof, shall be deemed released and waived by the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors as of the Effective Date.</p>
<p>The Reorganized Debtors may pursue such retained Causes of Action, as appropriate, in accordance  with  the  best  interests  of  the  Reorganized  Debtors. No  Entity  (other  than  the Released  Parties)  may  rely  on  the  absence  of  a  specific  reference  in  the  Plan,  the  Plan Supplement, or the Disclosure Statement to any Cause of Action against it as any indication that  the  Debtors  or  the  Reorganized  Debtors,  as  applicable,  will  not  pursue  any  and  all available Causes of Action of the Debtors against it, except as otherwise expressly provided in  this  Plan.    The  Debtors  and  the  Reorganized  Debtors  expressly  reserve  all  rights  to prosecute any and all Causes of Action against any Entity, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, including Article VIII hereof .  The Reorganized Debtors may settle any such Cause of Action without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.  If there is any dispute between the Reorganized Debtors and the Entity against whom the Reorganized Debtors are asserting the Cause of Action regarding the inclusion of any Cause of Action on the Schedule of Retained Causes of Action that remains unresolved for thirty days, such objection shall be resolved by the Bankruptcy Court.  Unless any Causes of Action of the Debtors against an Entity are expressly waived, relinquished, exculpated, released, compromised, assigned, transferred or settled in the Plan or a Final Order, the Reorganized Debtors expressly reserve all Causes  of  Action,  for  later  adjudication,  and,  therefore,  no  preclusion  doctrine,  including  the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion, estoppel (judicial, equitable,  or  otherwise),  or  laches,  shall  apply  to  such  Causes  of  Action  upon,  after,  or  as  a consequence of the Confirmation or Consummation.</p>
<p>The Reorganized Debtors reserve and shall retain such Causes of Action of the Debtors notwithstanding the rejection or repudiation (to the extent applicable) of any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease during the Chapter 11 Cases or pursuant to the Plan.  In accordance with section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, any Causes of Action that a Debtor may hold against any Entity shall vest in the Reorganized Debtors, except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, including Article VIII hereof.  The applicable Reorganized Debtors, through their authorized agents or representatives, shall retain and may exclusively enforce any and all such Causes of Action.    The  Reorganized  Debtors  shall  have  the  exclusive  right,  authority,  and  discretion  to determine and to initiate, file, prosecute, enforce, abandon, settle, compromise, release, withdraw, or litigate to judgment any such Causes of Action and to decline to do any of the foregoing without the consent or approval of any third party or further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<h2>U. Avoidance Actions</h2>
<p>The Reorganized Debtors shall retain all rights to commence and pursue any Avoidance Actions  (other  than  against  Released  Parties),  unless  such  Avoidance  Actions  are  settled  or resolved prior to the Effective Date with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders.</p>
<h2>V. Dissolution of Certain Debtors</h2>
<p>On the Effective Date, subject to the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders, certain of the Debtors may be dissolved without the need for any further approvals, authorizations, or consents (provided that, subject in all respects to the terms of the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors shall have the power and authority to take any action necessary to wind down and dissolve such Debtors, and shall: (a) file a certificate of dissolution for such Debtors to effect such  Debtors' dissolution  under  the  applicable  laws  of  their  states  of  formation;  (b)  to  the  extent  necessary, complete and file all final or otherwise required federal, state, and local tax returns and shall pay taxes required to be paid for such Debtors, and pursuant to section 505(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, request an expedited determination of any unpaid tax liability of any such Debtors or their Estates, as determined under applicable tax laws; and (c) represent the interests of the Debtors or their Estates before any taxing authority in all tax matters, including any action, proceeding or audit).</p>
<h2>W. Intercompany Interests</h2>
<p>On the Effective Date and without the need for any further corporate action or approval of any board of directors, board of managers, managers, management, or shareholders of any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, the certificates and all other documents representing the Intercompany Interests shall be deemed to be in full force and effect.</p>
<h2>X. Restructuring Expenses</h2>
<p>The outstanding Restructuring Expenses incurred, or estimated to be incurred, up to and including the Effective Date (whether incurred prepetition or postpetition) shall be paid in full in Cash on the Effective Date (to the extent not previously paid during the course of the Chapter 11 Cases)  in  accordance  with,  and  subject  to,  the  terms  of  (x)(i)  any  engagement  letters  or  fee reimbursement  letters  entered  into  (whether  prior  to,  or  after,  the  Petition  Date)  between  the Debtors and the Ad Hoc Group Advisors, (ii) the Restructuring Support Agreement, (iii) the DIP Orders, or (iv) the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement, and/or (y) sections 503(b) and 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, and, in each case, and without the need to file any fee application or for any further notice or approval by the Bankruptcy Court or otherwise.  All Restructuring Expenses to be paid on the Effective Date shall be estimated prior to and as of the Effective Date and such estimates shall be delivered to the Debtors at least three (3) Business Days before the anticipated Effective Date (or such shorter period as the Debtors may agree); provided , that such estimate shall not be considered an admission or limitation with respect to such Restructuring Expenses.  As promptly as practicable following the Effective Date, final invoices for all Restructuring Expenses incurred prior to and as of the Effective Date shall be submitted to the Debtors.</p>
<h2>Y. Exit Facility Backstop Agreement</h2>
<p>Each  Exit  Facility  Backstop  Party  shall  satisfy  its  respective  Exit  Facility  Backstop Commitment on the Effective Date, pursuant to the mechanics set forth herein, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement.  An Exit Facility Backstop Party's funding obligations with respect to the TL Exit Facility Backstop shall be based on the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Any Exit Facility Backstop Party (in such capacity) that holds the same percentage of Prepetition First Lien Claims (relative to the aggregate amount of all Prepetition First Lien Claims) and Prepetition Second Lien Claims (relative to all Prepetition Second Lien Claims ) shall be required to roll their Prepetition First Lien Claims into the TL Exit Facility and receive TL Exit Facility Loans on the terms provided above, which roll shall satisfy in full such Exit Facility Backstop Party's TL Exit Facility Backstop Commitment.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">Any Exit Facility Backstop Party (in such capacity) that holds a greater percentage of Prepetition First Lien Claims (relative to the aggregate amount of all Prepetition First Lien Claims) as compared to such Exit Facility Backstop Party's holdings of Prepetition Second Lien Claims  (relative to all Prepetition Second Lien Claims) shall  be  (i)  required  to  roll  the  same  percentage  of  their  Prepetition  First  Lien Claims that is equal to their percentage of Prepetition Second Lien Claims into the TL Exit Facility and receive TL Exit Facility Loans on the terms provided above, which roll shall satisfy in full such Exit Facility Backstop Party's TL Exit Facility Backstop Commitment and (ii) may elect to either roll their remaining percentage of their Prepetition First Lien Claims into the TL Exit Facility or receive payment in full, in cash, for such remaining percentage on the terms set above.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">Any Exit Facility Backstop Party (in such capacity) that holds a lesser percentage of Prepetition First Lien Claims (relative to the aggregate amount of all Prepetition First Lien Claims) as compared to such Exit Facility Backstop Party's holdings of Prepetition Second Lien Claims  (relative to all Prepetition Second Lien Claims ) shall be (i) required to roll the full amount of their Prepetition First Lien Claims into the TL Exit Facility on the terms provided above, and (ii) if necessary, required to fund new cash equal to a percentage of the TL Exit Facility equal to the difference between such holder's percentage of Prepetition First Lien Claims (relative to the aggregate amount of all Prepetition First Lien Claims) and Prepetition Second Lien Claims  (relative to all Prepetition Second Lien Claims ), which collectively shall satisfy  in  full  such  Exit  Facility  Backstop  Party's  TL  Exit  Facility  Backstop Commitment.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, holders of Prepetition Second Lien Claims shall have the right to designate its funding obligations to an affiliate or related fund pursuant to the terms of the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement.</p>

<h2>TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: 'A. ';">Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases</li>
</ol>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in this Plan, on and as of the Effective Date, each Executory Contract  and  Unexpired  Lease  shall  be  deemed  assumed  (or  assumed  and  assigned  to  the respective Reorganized Debtor, as applicable), without the need for any further notice to or action, separate order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code unless such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease (i) previously expired or</p>
<p>terminated pursuant to its own terms, (ii) is on the Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases Schedule (if any) as of the Effective Date, or (iii) is the subject of a motion to reject filed on or before the Effective Date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, the Debtors and the Requisite Consenting Lenders will work together to determine whether to seek to reject any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.</p>
<p>The Debtors' and counterparties' respective rights and obligations under each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease assumed under the Plan shall be unaffected by these Chapter 11 Cases, and the obligations arising under such Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases assumed under the Plan will be performed in the ordinary course of business pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the Confirmation Order, and such Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the Debtors (with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders) and the applicable counterparty, each assumed Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease shall include all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other agreements related thereto, and all rights related thereto, if any, including all easements, licenses,  permits,  rights,  privileges,  immunities,  options,  rights  of  first  refusal,  and  any  other interests.    Modifications,  amendments, supplements, and restatements to prepetition Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that have been executed by the Debtors during the Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter the prepetition nature of the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or the validity, priority, or amount of any Claims that may arise in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Entry of the Confirmation Order shall constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the assumptions, and assumptions and assignments, of the Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases as set forth in the Plan under sections 365(a) and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code.  Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, assumptions of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases pursuant to the Plan are effective as of the Effective Date.  Each Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease assumed pursuant to the Plan or by Bankruptcy Court order but not assigned to a third party on or before the Effective Date shall re-vest in and be fully enforceable by the applicable Reorganized Debtor  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  except  as  such  terms  may  have  been  modified  by  the provisions of the Plan or any order of the Bankruptcy Court authorizing and providing for its assumption.</p>
<p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, to the extent any provision in any Executory Contract  or  Unexpired  Lease  assumed  or  assumed  and  assigned  pursuant  to  the  Plan  restricts, conditions,  or  prevents,  or  purports  to  restrict,  condition,  or  prevent,  or  is  breached  or  deemed breached by, the assumption or assumption and assignment of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease (including any 'change of control' provision), then such provision shall be deemed modified such that the transactions contemplated by the Plan shall not entitle the non-Debtor party thereto to terminate such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or to exercise any other default-related rights with respect thereto.  Any provision in any such contract or lease that permits a Person to terminate or  modify  such  agreement  or  to  otherwise  modify  the  rights  of  the  Debtors  or  the  Reorganized Debtors or  assignee,  as  applicable,  based  on  the  filing  of  the  Chapter  11  Cases  or  the  financial condition of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, will be unenforceable.</p>
<p>To the extent any provision of the Bankruptcy Code or the Bankruptcy Rules requires the Debtors to assume or reject an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, such requirement shall be</p>
<p>satisfied if (1) in the case of assumption, the Debtors do not identify such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease on the Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases Schedule (if any); and (2) in the case of rejection, the Debtors identify such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease in the Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases Schedule (if any), in each case prior to any deadline  set  forth  by  the  Bankruptcy  Code,  the  Bankruptcy  Rules,  or  Bankruptcy  Court  order (including the Procedures Order), as applicable, regardless of whether or not the Bankruptcy Court has actually ruled on such proposed assumption or rejection prior to such deadline.</p>
<h2>B. Objections to Assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases</h2>
<p>In accordance with, and as set forth in, the Notice of (I) Commencement of Prepackaged Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases, (II) Combined Hearing on the Disclosure Statement, Confirmation of the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan, and Related Matters, and (III) Objection Deadline [D.I. 69-1], any counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that wishes to object to the assumption of its Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease (including as to the amounts, if any, due thereunder) was required to do so by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on January 12, 2024.</p>
<p>Any counterparty to an assumed Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that failed to timely (i) file an objection asserting that amounts were due as a result of a Debtor's monetary default under an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to be assumed under the Plan, or (ii) otherwise object to the Debtors' assumption of an Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease under the  Plan,  including  an  objection  regarding  the  ability  of  the  Reorganized  Debtors  to  provide 'adequate assurance of future performance' (within the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code), will be (x) deemed to have consented to the such proposed assumption, (y) deemed to have forever  released  and  waived  such  objections,  (y)  forever  barred  from  being  heard  on  such objections, and (z) forever barred from imposing or charging against any Reorganized Debtor any accelerations, increases or any other fees as a result of any assumption under the Plan.  To the extent any objections as to the foregoing are filed, such disputes may be heard by the Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation Hearing or preserved for a future hearing by agreement of the Debtors and  the  objecting  counterparty.  The  Reorganized  Debtors  also  may  settle  any  such  preserved disputes after entry of the Confirmation Order without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>Any Proof of Claim Filed with respect to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that  is  assumed  shall  be  deemed  expunged,  without  further  notice  to,  action,  order  or approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that the Debtors shall (i) include in the notice of the occurrence of the Effective Date the immediately preceding statement and (ii) provide a separate notice (which notice may be transmitted via email) to each Holder that Filed a Proof of Claim with respect to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, stating that the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease related to such Proof of Claim was assumed under the Plan and any such Proof of Claim is expunged.</p>
<h2>C. Preexisting Obligations to the Debtors Under Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases</h2>
<p>To the extent applicable, rejection of any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease pursuant to the Plan or otherwise shall not constitute a termination of preexisting obligations owed to the</p>
<p>Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, under such Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases.  In particular, notwithstanding any non-bankruptcy law to the contrary, the Reorganized Debtors expressly reserve and do not waive any right to receive, or any continuing obligation of a counterparty  to  provide,  (a)  payment  to  the  contracting  Debtors  or  Reorganized  Debtors,  as applicable, of outstanding and future amounts owing thereto under or in connection with rejected Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases or (b) warranties or continued maintenance obligations with respect to goods previously purchased by the Debtors pursuant to rejected Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases (if any).</p>
<h2>D. Insurance Policies</h2>
<p>Each of the Debtors' insurance policies and any agreements, documents, or instruments relating thereto, are treated as Executory Contracts under the Plan.  Unless otherwise provided in the Plan, on the Effective Date, (1) the Debtors shall be deemed to have assumed all insurance policies and any agreements, documents, and instruments relating to coverage of all insured Claims and (2) such insurance policies and any agreements, documents, or instruments relating thereto shall revest in the Reorganized Debtors.</p>
<h2>E. Reservation of Rights</h2>
<p>Nothing contained in the Plan or the Plan Supplement shall constitute an admission by the Debtors or any other party that any contract or lease is in fact an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that any Reorganized Debtor has any liability thereunder.  If there is a dispute regarding whether a contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption or rejection (to the extent applicable), the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall have fortyfive days following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter their treatment of such contract or lease.</p>
<h2>F. Nonoccurrence of Effective Date</h2>
<p>In  the  event  that  the  Effective  Date  does  not  occur,  the  Bankruptcy  Court  shall  retain jurisdiction with respect to any request to extend the deadline for assuming or rejecting Unexpired Leases pursuant to section 365(d)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<h2>G. Employee Compensation and Benefits</h2>
<h2>1. Compensation and Benefits Programs</h2>
<p>Except  as  set  forth  herein,  and  except  as  otherwise  provided  under  the  Restructuring Support  Agreement  (including  with  respect  to  those  agreements  set  forth  on  Annex B  to  the Restructuring Term Sheet and as set forth in the final sentence of this paragraph), the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall continue and assume, according to existing terms and practices, solely  those  Compensation  and  Benefits  Programs  that  were  disclosed  to  the Requisite  Consenting  Lenders  as  of  the  Restructuring  Support  Agreement  Effective  Date, including, for the avoidance of doubt, payment in full in cash of all Claims arising thereunder or related  thereto  as  and  when  due,  including  executive  compensation  programs,  and  including payment in full in cash under the 2023 Annual Incentive Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation and Benefits Programs contemplated under the agreements set forth on Annex B</p>
<p>to the Restructuring Term Sheet may be continued solely under the terms and conditions set forth in  the  revised  agreements  entered  into  between  the  Debtors  and  the  respective  employee,  as previously consented to by the Requisite Consenting Lenders, and without regard to historical terms and practices.  The amounts which the Debtors shall pay under any bonus plans shall not exceed the amounts set forth on Annex C to the Restructuring Term Sheet, as may be modified under the existing terms and conditions set forth in Exhibit I of that certain Second Notice of Filing of Plan Supplement to the Joint Prepackaged Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust and Its Debtor-Affiliates [D.I. 148].</p>
<p>Subject  to  the  consent  of  the  Required  Consenting  Lenders,  the  Debtors  or  the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, may enter into new agreements with the officers and other employees on terms and conditions consistent with those set forth in the Plan Supplement, if any.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code, from and after the Effective Date, all retiree benefits (as such term is defined in section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code), if any, shall continue to be paid in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<p>Subject to the provisions of the Plan, and except as otherwise provided in the Restructuring Support  Agreement  (including  the  Restructuring  Term  Sheet),  all  Compensation  and  Benefits Programs shall be treated as Executory Contracts under the Plan and deemed assumed on the Effective Date pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, except for:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) all employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and any provisions set forth in the Compensation and Benefits Programs that provide for rights to acquire  Existing  Equity  Interests  in  any  of  the  Debtors,  which  shall  not constitute  or  be  deemed  to  constitute  Executory  Contracts  and  shall  be deemed terminated on the Effective Date;</li>
<li>(b) any  sale  bonus  agreements,  which  shall  not  constitute  or  be  deemed  to constitute  Executory  Contracts  and  shall  be  deemed  terminated  on  the Effective Date;</li>
<li>(c) Compensation and Benefits Programs that have been rejected pursuant to an order of a Bankruptcy Court, including the Confirmation Order;</li>
<li>(d) Compensation  and  Benefits Programs  that, as of the entry of the Confirmation Order, have been specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee benefit plan or contract; and</li>
<li>(e) employment agreements, employment letters, indemnification agreements, severance  plans  and  amendments,  severance  letters,  retention  plans  and letters, and annual incentive plans, in each case that have not been disclosed to the Requisite Consenting Lenders on or before the Restructuring Support Agreement Effective Date.</li>
</ul>
<p>A counterparty to a Compensation and Benefits Program assumed or assumed and assigned pursuant to the Plan shall have the same rights under such Compensation and Benefits Program as such counterparty had thereunder immediately prior to such assumption (unless otherwise agreed</p>
<p>by such counterparty and the applicable Reorganized Debtor(s), with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders).</p>
<h2>2. Workers' Compensation Programs</h2>
<p>As of the Effective Date, except as set forth in the Plan Supplement, the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors shall continue to honor their obligations under:  (a) all applicable workers' compensation  laws  in  states  in  which  the  Reorganized  Debtors  operate;  and  (b)  the  Debtors' written  contracts,  agreements,  agreements  of  indemnity,  self-insured  workers'  compensation bonds,  policies,  programs,  and  plans  for  workers'  compensation  and  workers'  compensation insurance.  All Proofs of Claims on account of workers' compensation shall be deemed withdrawn automatically and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that nothing in the Plan shall limit, diminish, or otherwise alter the Debtors' or Reorganized Debtors' defenses, Causes of Action, or other rights under applicable non-bankruptcy law with respect to any such contracts, agreements, policies, programs, and plans; provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed to impose any obligations on the Debtors in addition to what is provided for under applicable non-bankruptcy law.</p>
<h2>H. Contracts and Leases Entered into After the Petition Date</h2>
<p>Contracts  and  leases  entered  into  after  the  Petition  Date  by  any  Debtor,  including  any Executory Contracts  and  Unexpired  Leases  assumed  by  such  Debtor,  will  be  performed  by  the applicable Debtor or Reorganized Debtor in the ordinary course of its business.  Accordingly, such contracts  and  leases  (including  any  assumed  Executory  Contracts  and  Unexpired  Leases)  will survive and remain unaffected by entry of the Confirmation Order.</p>
<h2>ARTICLE VI.</h2>
<h2>PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS</h2>
<h2>A. Distributions on Account of Claims Allowed as of the Effective Date</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, in a Final Order, or as otherwise agreed to by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, and the Holder of the applicable Allowed Claim on the first Distribution Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall make initial distributions under the  Plan  on  account  of  Claims  Allowed  on  or  after  Effective  Date,  subject  to  the  Reorganized Debtors' right to object to Claims; provided that (1) Allowed Administrative Claims with respect to liabilities incurred by the Debtors in the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 Cases or assumed by the Debtors prior to the Effective Date shall be paid or performed in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the terms and conditions of any controlling agreements, course of dealing, course of business, or industry practice, (2) Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall be paid in accordance with Article II.D of the Plan, and (3) Allowed General Unsecured Claims shall be paid in accordance with Article III.B.6 of the Plan.  To the extent any Allowed Priority Tax Claim is not due and owing on the Effective Date, such Claim shall be paid in full in Cash in accordance with the terms of any agreement between the Debtors and the Holder of such Claim or as  may  be  due  and  payable  under  applicable  non-bankruptcy  law  or  in  the  ordinary  course  of business.</p>
<p>The Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall  take  all  such  reasonable actions as may be required to cause the distribution of the Equity Distribution to holders of Existing Preferred Equity Interests, holders of Existing Common Equity Interests, and holders of Existing PREIT  Associates  LP  Interests  in  accordance  with  and  as  contemplated  under  the  Plan. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, to the extent a holder of Existing Common Equity Interests and/or Existing Preferred Equity Interests holds such interests through DTC, such Equity Distribution attributable to such holders shall be effectuated through the facilities of DTC, to the extent practicable.  The Equity Distribution to holders of Existing Preferred Equity Interests, holders of Existing Common Equity Interests and holders of Existing PREIT Associates LP shall be deemed issued on the Effective Date regardless of when the distribution actually occurs.</p>
<h2>B. Disbursing Agent</h2>
<p>All Plan Distributions shall be made by the Disbursing Agent.  The Disbursing Agent shall not be required to give any bond or surety or other security for the performance of its duties unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.  Additionally, in the event that the Disbursing Agent is so otherwise ordered, all costs and expenses of procuring any such bond or surety shall be borne by the Reorganized Debtors.</p>
<p>All Plan Distributions shall be deemed completed by the Debtors when received by such Disbursing Agent.  The Plan Distributions shall be made to any such Holders at the direction of the applicable Disbursing Agent.</p>
<h2>C. Rights and Powers of Disbursing Agent</h2>
<h2>1. Powers of the Disbursing Agent</h2>
<p>The  Disbursing  Agent  shall  be  empowered  to:  (a)  effect  all  actions  and  execute  all agreements,  instruments,  and  other  documents  necessary  to  perform  its  duties  under  the  Plan; (b) make  all  distributions  contemplated  hereby;  (c)  employ  professionals  to  represent  it  with respect to its responsibilities; and (d) exercise such other powers as may be vested in the Disbursing Agent by order of the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to the Plan or as deemed by the Disbursing Agent to be necessary and proper to implement the provisions hereof.</p>
<h2>2. Expenses Incurred on or After the Effective Date</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of any reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Disbursing Agent on or after the Effective Date (including taxes), and  any  reasonable  compensation  and  expense  reimbursement  claims  (including  reasonable attorney  fees  and  expenses),  made  by  the  Disbursing  Agent  shall  be  paid  in  Cash  by  the Reorganized Debtors; provided, however, that any such fees and expenses that constitute Equity Costs shall reduce the Equity Distribution.</p>
<h2>D. Delivery of Distributions and Undeliverable or Unclaimed Distributions</h2>
<h2>1. Record Date for Distribution</h2>
<p>On  the  Distribution  Record  Date,  the  Claims  Register  shall  be  closed  and  any  party responsible for making distributions shall instead be authorized and entitled to recognize only those record Holders listed on the Claims Register as of the close of business on the Distribution Record Date.  If a Claim is transferred twenty or fewer days before the Distribution Record Date, the Disbursing Agent shall make distributions to the transferee only to the extent practical and, in any event, only if the relevant transfer form contains an unconditional and explicit certification and waiver of any objection to the transfer by the transferor.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Distribution Record Date shall not apply to the Debtors' publicly traded securities, including the Existing Preferred Equity Interests and the Existing Common Equity Interests, the distributions to which  shall  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  DTC's  standard  procedures  and  customary practices.</p>
<h2>2. Delivery of Distributions in General</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, distributions payable to Holders of Allowed Claims shall be made by the Disbursing Agent to such Holder at the address for each such Holder as indicated on the Debtors' records as of the date of any such distribution; provided that the manner of such distributions shall be determined at the discretion of the Reorganized Debtors.</p>
<h2>3. Delivery of New Common Stock</h2>
<p>On the Effective Date, Reorganized PREIT is authorized to issue or cause to be issued and shall  issue  the  New  Common  Stock  for  distribution  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  Plan without the need for any further board, shareholder or other corporate action.  All of the New Common Stock issuable under the Plan, when so issued, shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable.  To the extent applicable, the New Governance Documents shall provide for sufficient authorized New Common Stock to effectuate the issuance of New Common Stock contemplated by and in connection with the Plan.  Reorganized PREIT shall issue or reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of New Common Stock to effectuate all such issuances. Each holder of New Common Stock shall be deemed, without further notice or action, to have agreed to be bound by the New Governance Documents, as the same may be amended from time to  time  following  the  Effective  Date  in  accordance  with  their  terms.    The  New  Governance Documents shall be binding on all Entities receiving New Common Shares (and their respective successors  and  assigns),  whether  received  pursuant  to  the  Plan  or  otherwise  and  regardless  of whether such Entity executes or delivers a signature page to the New Governance Document. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Debtors  or  the  Reorganized  Debtors,  as  applicable,  may condition  the  distribution  of  any  New  Common  Stock  issued  pursuant  to  the  Plan  upon  the recipient  thereof  duly  executing  and  delivering  to  the  Debtors  or  the  Reorganized  Debtors,  as applicable, counter-signatures to one or more New Governance Documents.</p>
<h2>4. Minimum Distributions</h2>
<p>No fractional shares of New Common Stock (including Put Option Securities) shall be distributed  and  no  Cash  shall  be  distributed  in  lieu  of  such  fractional  amounts.    When  any distribution pursuant to the Plan on account of an Allowed Claim or on account of the Exit Facility Backstop Commitment Premium would otherwise result in the issuance of a number of shares of New Common Stock that is not a whole number, the Company and the Requisite Consenting</p>
<p>Lenders may determine to make adjustments as necessary so that the total amount of shares of New Common Stock is fixed, including by rounding the distribution of shares of New Common Stock as follows:  (a) fractions of one-half ( 1 /2) or greater shall be rounded to the next higher whole number and (b) fractions of less than one-half ( 1 /2) shall be rounded to the next lower whole number with no further payment therefor; provided that the  total  number  of  authorized  shares  of New Common Stock to be distributed to Holders of Allowed Claims hereunder shall be adjusted as necessary to account for the foregoing rounding.  For purposes of determining whether a person would otherwise receive a fraction of a share of New Common Stock, all shares of New Common Stock to be issued to such person shall be aggregated.</p>
<h2>5. Undeliverable Distributions and Unclaimed Property</h2>
<p>In  the  event  that  any  distribution  to  any  Holder  of  Allowed  Claims  is  returned  as undeliverable, no distribution to such Holder shall be made unless and until the Disbursing Agent has determined the then-current address of such Holder, at which time such distribution shall be made to such Holder without interest; provided that such distributions shall be deemed unclaimed property under section 347(b) of the Bankruptcy Code at the expiration of six months from the Effective Date.  After such date, all unclaimed property or interests in property shall revert to the Reorganized Debtors automatically and without need for a further order by the Bankruptcy Court (notwithstanding  any  applicable  federal,  provincial  or  state  escheat,  abandoned,  or  unclaimed property  laws  to  the  contrary)  and,  to  the  extent  such  unclaimed  distribution  comprises  New Common Stock, such New Common Stock shall be canceled.  Upon such revesting, the Claim of the Holder or its successors with respect to such property shall be canceled, discharged, and forever barred notwithstanding any applicable federal or state escheat, abandoned, or unclaimed property laws,  or  any  provisions  in  any  document  governing  the  distribution  that  is  an  Unclaimed Distribution, to the contrary.  The Disbursing Agent shall adjust the number of shares of New Common Stock outstanding as of the date of such cancelation to ensure that the distributions of New Common Stock contemplated under the Plan are given full force and effect.</p>
<h2>6. Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities</h2>
<p>On the Effective Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, each Holder of a certificate or instrument evidencing a Claim or an Interest that has been canceled in accordance with Article IV.I hereof shall be deemed to have surrendered such certificate or instrument to the Disbursing Agent.  Such surrendered certificate or instrument shall be canceled solely with respect to the Debtors, and such cancelation shall not alter the obligations or rights of any non-Debtor third parties  in  respect  of  one  another  with  respect  to  such  certificate  or  instrument,  including  with respect to any indenture or agreement that governs the rights of the Holder of a Claim or Interest, which shall continue in effect for purposes of allowing Holders to receive distributions under the Plan, charging liens, priority of payment, and indemnification rights.</p>
<h2>E. Manner of Payment</h2>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '1. ';">Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or any agreement, instrument, or other document incorporated by the Plan or the Plan Supplement, all distributions of the New Common Stock  to  the  Holders  of  the  applicable  Allowed  Claims  under  the  Plan  shall  be  made  by  the Disbursing Agent on behalf of the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: '2. ';">All distributions of Cash to the Holders of the applicable Allowed Claims under the Plan shall be made by the Disbursing Agent on behalf of the applicable Debtor or Reorganized Debtor.</li>
<li style="list-style-type: '3. ';">At the option of the Disbursing Agent, any Cash payment to be made hereunder may  be  made  by  check  or  wire  transfer  or  as  otherwise  required  or  provided  in  applicable agreements.</li>
</ol>
<h2>F. Indefeasible Distributions</h2>
<p>Any and all distributions  made  under  the  Plan  shall  be  indefeasible  and  not  subject  to clawback or turnover provisions.</p>
<h2>G. Securities Law Matters</h2>
<p>Pursuant to section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, the offering, issuance, and distribution of the New Common Stock, but excluding the MIP New Common Stock and the Put Option Securities, in each case, after the Petition Date, shall be exempt from, among other things, the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act or any similar federal, state, or local law in reliance on section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code or, only to the extent such exemption under Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code is not available, any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act.  Pursuant to section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code, such New Common Stock (other than the MIP New Common Stock and Put Option Securities) will be  freely  tradable  in  the  United  States  without  registration  under  the  Securities  Act  by  the recipients thereof, subject to the provisions of (1) section 1145(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code relating  to  the  definition  of  an  underwriter  in  section  2(a)(11)  of  the  Securities  Act  and compliance  with  any  applicable  state  or  foreign  securities  laws,  if  any,  and  the  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, if any, applicable at the time of any future transfer of such Securities or instruments, (2) any other applicable regulatory approvals, and (3) any restrictions in the New Governance Documents.  The MIP New Common Stock and the Put Option Securities, in each case, will be offered, issued, and distributed in reliance upon section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>Any Securities  distributed  pursuant  to  section  4(a)(2)  under  the  Securities  Act  will  be considered 'restricted securities' as defined by Rule 144 of the Securities Act and may not be resold under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws absent an effective registration statement, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from registration, under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws and subject to any restrictions in the New Governance Documents.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, no Entity shall be entitled to require a legal opinion regarding the validity of any transaction contemplated by the Plan, including, for the avoidance of doubt, whether the New Common Stock and any MIP New Common Stock are exempt from the registration requirements of section 5 of the Securities Act.</p>
<p>Recipients of the New Common Stock, including any MIP New Common Stock and Put Option Securities, are advised to consult with their own legal advisors as to the availability of any exemption from registration under the Securities Act and any applicable Blue Sky Laws.</p>
<h2>H. Compliance with Tax Requirements</h2>
<p>In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, Disbursing Agent, and any applicable withholding agent shall comply with all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on them by any Governmental Unit, and all distributions made pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to  such  withholding  and reporting requirements. Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, such parties shall be authorized to take all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such withholding and reporting requirements, including liquidating a portion of the distribution to be made under the Plan to generate sufficient funds to pay  applicable withholding  taxes, withholding  distributions pending  receipt of information necessary to facilitate such distributions, or establishing any other mechanisms they believe  are  reasonable  and  appropriate  (subject  to  reasonable  consultation  with  the  Requisite Consenting  Lenders).    The  Debtors  and  Reorganized  Debtors  reserve  the  right  to  allocate  all distributions made under the Plan in compliance with all applicable wage garnishments, alimony, child support, and similar spousal awards, Liens, and encumbrances.</p>
<p>Any  Holder  of  an  Allowed  Claim  entitled  to  receive  any  property  as  an  issuance  or distribution under the Plan shall, upon request by the Disbursing Agent, provide an appropriate Form W-9 or (if the payee is a foreign Person) Form W-8 and/or any other forms or documents, as applicable, requested by any Reorganized Debtor or Disbursing Agent, as applicable, to reduce or eliminate any required federal, state, or local withholding.  If such request is made and such Holder of an Impaired Claim fails to comply before the date that is 180 days after the request is made, the amount of such distribution shall irrevocably revert to the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors,  as  applicable,  and  any  Claim  in  respect  of  such  distribution  shall  be  discharged  and forever barred from assertion against the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors and their respective property.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, each holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest that is to receive a distribution under the Plan shall have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and payment of any tax obligations imposed on such holder by any governmental unit, including income, withholding, and other tax obligations, on account of such distribution.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the obligations of the Backstop Parties and the rights of the Debtors with respect to any taxes applicable to the Exit Facility Backstop Commitment Premium shall be governed exclusively by the Exit Facility Backstop Agreement.</p>
<h2>I. Allocations</h2>
<p>Distributions in respect of Allowed Claims shall be allocated first to the principal amount of  such  Claims  (as  determined  for  federal  income  tax  purposes)  and  then,  to  the  extent  the consideration  exceeds  the  principal  amount  of  the  Claims,  to  any  portion  of  such  Claims  for accrued but unpaid interest.</p>
<h2>J. No Postpetition or Default Interest on Claims</h2>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically provided for in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, or required by applicable bankruptcy and non-bankruptcy law, and  notwithstanding  any  documents  that  govern  the  Debtors'  prepetition  indebtedness  to  the</p>
<p>contrary, (1) postpetition and/or default interest shall not accrue or be paid on any prepetition Claims and (2) no Holder of a Claim shall be entitled to (a) interest accruing on or after the Petition Date on such Claim or (b) interest at the contract default rate, as applicable.  Additionally, and without limiting the foregoing, interest shall not accrue or be paid on any Disputed Claim with respect to the period from the Effective Date to the date a final distribution is made on account of such Disputed Claim, if and when such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim.</p>
<h2>K. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in a Bankruptcy Court order, as of the Effective Date, any Claim asserted in currency other than U.S. dollars shall be automatically deemed converted to the equivalent U.S. dollar value using the exchange rate for the applicable currency as published in The Wall Street Journal, National Edition, on the Effective Date.</p>
<h2>L. Setoffs and Recoupment</h2>
<p>Except  as  expressly  provided  in  this  Plan,  each  Reorganized  Debtor  may,  pursuant  to section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code, set off and/or recoup against any Plan Distributions to be made on account of any Allowed Claim and Allowed Interests, any and all claims, rights, and Causes of Action that such Reorganized Debtor may hold against the Holder of such Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest to the extent such setoff or recoupment is either (1) agreed in amount among the  relevant  Reorganized  Debtor(s)  and  the  Holder  of  the  Allowed  Claim  or  Allowed Interest  or  (2)  otherwise  adjudicated  by  the  Bankruptcy  Court  or  another  court  of  competent jurisdiction; provided that neither the failure to effectuate a setoff or recoupment nor the allowance of  any  Claim  hereunder  shall  constitute  a  waiver  or  release  by  a  Reorganized  Debtor  or  its successor of any and all claims, rights, and Causes of Action that such Reorganized Debtor or its successor may possess against the applicable Holder.  In no event shall any Holder of a Claim or Interest be entitled to recoup such Claim or Interest against any claim, right, or Cause of Action of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, unless such Holder actually has performed such recoupment and provided notice thereof in writing to the Debtors in accordance with Article XII.G hereof on or before the Effective Date, notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or proof of Interest or otherwise that such Holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of recoupment.</p>
<h2>M. Claims Paid or Payable by Third Parties</h2>
<h2>1. Claims Paid by Third Parties</h2>
<p>The Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall reduce in full a Claim, and such Claim shall be disallowed without a Claims objection having to be Filed and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, to the extent that the Holder of such Claim receives payment in full on account of such Claim from a party that is not a Debtor or a Reorganized Debtor.  Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, to the extent a Holder of a Claim receives a distribution on account of such Claim and receives payment from a party that is not a Debtor or a Reorganized Debtor on account of such Claim, such Holder shall, within fourteen days of receipt thereof, repay or return the distribution to the applicable Reorganized Debtor, to the extent the Holder's total recovery on account of such Claim from the third party and under the Plan exceeds</p>
<p>the amount of such Claim as of the date of any such distribution under the Plan.  The failure of such Holder to timely repay or return such distribution shall result in the Holder owing the applicable Reorganized Debtor annualized interest at the Federal Judgment Rate on such amount owed for each Business Day after the fourteen-day grace period specified above until the amount is repaid.</p>
<h2>2. Applicability of Insurance Policies</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims shall be in accordance with the provisions of any applicable insurance policy.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any Cause of Action that the Debtors or any Entity may hold against any other Entity, including Insurers under any policies of insurance, nor shall anything contained herein constitute or be deemed a waiver by such Insurers of any defenses, including coverage defenses, held by such Insurers.</p>
<h2>ARTICLE VII.</h2>
<h2>PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING CONTINGENT, UNLIQUIDATED, AND DISPUTED CLAIMS</h2>
<h2>A. Disputed Claims Process</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, and in light of the Unimpaired status of all Allowed General Unsecured Claims under the Plan, there is no requirement to file a Proof of Claim (or move the Bankruptcy Court for allowance) to have a Claim Allowed for the purposes of the Plan, except as provided in Article V.B of the Plan.  On and after the Effective Date,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Plan,  all  Allowed  Claims  shall  be  satisfied  in  the ordinary course of business of the Reorganized Debtors as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced (except that, unless expressly waived pursuant to the Plan, the Allowed amount of such Claims shall be subject to the limitations or maximum amounts permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 502 and 503 of the Bankruptcy Code).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person or entity that holds a Claim that arises from the rejection of an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease must file a Proof of Claim based on such rejection no later than the date that is thirty days following the later of (a) the Effective Date and (b) entry of an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the rejection of such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.</p>
<p>Upon the Effective Date and in light of the Unimpaired status of all Allowed General Unsecured Claims under the Plan, all Proofs of Claim filed against the Debtors, regardless of the time of filing, and including Proofs of Claim filed after the Effective Date, shall be deemed expunged, without further notice to , action, order or approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that the Debtors shall (i) include in the notice of the occurrence of the Effective Date the immediately preceding statement and (ii) provide a separate notice (which notice may be transmitted via email) to each holder that Filed a Proof of Claim, stating the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, within 90 days from the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors must object to any Disputed Proof of Claim Filed as to any Claim resulting from rejection (if any) of an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.</p>
<p>The Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders, shall  have  the  exclusive  authority  to  (1)  determine,  without  the  need  for</p>
<p>notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, that a claim subject to any Proof of Claim that is Filed is Allowed and (2) file, settle, compromise, withdraw, or litigate to judgment any objections to Claims as permitted under this Plan.  If the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors dispute any Claim, such dispute shall be determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in the manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced and shall survive the Effective Date as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced (except that, unless expressly waived pursuant to the Plan, the Allowed amount of such Claims shall be subject to the limitations or maximum amounts permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 502 and 503 of the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<h2>B. Allowance of Claims</h2>
<p>After  the  Effective  Date,  except  as  otherwise  expressly  set  forth  herein,  each  of  the Reorganized Debtors shall have and retain any and all rights and defenses such Debtor had with respect to any Claim or Interest immediately prior to the Effective Date.  The Reorganized Debtors, with  the  consent  of  the  Requisite  Consenting  Lenders,  may  affirmatively  determine  to  deem Unimpaired Claims Allowed to the same extent such Claims would be allowed under applicable non-bankruptcy law.</p>
<h2>C. Claims Administration Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Except  as  otherwise  specifically  provided  in  the  Plan,  after  the  Effective  Date,  the Reorganized Debtors shall have the sole authority:  (1) to File, withdraw, or litigate to judgment, objections to Claims or Interests; (2) to settle or compromise any Disputed Claim without any further notice to or action, order, or approval by the Bankruptcy Court; and (3) to administer and adjust the Claims Register to reflect any such settlements or compromises without any further notice to or action, order, or approval by the Bankruptcy Court.  For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise provided herein, from and after the Effective Date, each Reorganized Debtor shall have and retain any and all rights and defenses such Debtor had immediately prior to the Effective Date with respect to any Disputed Claim or Interest, including the Causes of Action retained pursuant to Article IV.T of the Plan.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors and Reorganized Debtors, with the consent of the  Requisite  Consenting  Lenders,  shall  be  entitled  to  dispute  and/or  otherwise  object  to  any Administrative Claim, Other Priority Claim, Other Secured Claim, or General Unsecured Claim in accordance with applicable nonbankruptcy law.  If the Debtors, or Reorganized Debtors, with the consent of the Requisite Consenting Lenders, dispute any Administrative Claim, Other Priority Claim,  Other  Secured  Claim,  or  General  Unsecured  Claim,  such  dispute  may  be  determined, resolved, or adjudicated, as the case may be, in the manner as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced (except that, unless expressly waived pursuant to the Plan, the Allowed amount of such Claims shall be subject to the limitations or maximum amounts permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 502 and 503 of the Bankruptcy Code).  In any action or proceeding to determine the existence, validity, or amount of any Administrative Claim, Other Priority Claim, Other Secured Claim, or General Unsecured Claim, any and all claims or defenses that could have been asserted by the applicable Debtor(s) or the Entity holding such Claim are preserved as if the Chapter 11 Cases had not been commenced, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Allowed</p>
<p>amount of such Claims shall be subject to the limitations or maximum amounts permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 502 and 503 of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent applicable.</p>
<h2>D. Estimation of Claims and Interests</h2>
<p>Before or after the Effective Date, the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, may (but are not required to) at any time request that the Bankruptcy Court estimate any Disputed Claim or Interest that is contingent or unliquidated pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code for any reason, regardless of whether any party previously has objected to such Claim or Interest or whether the Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any such objection, and the Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to estimate any such Claim or Interest, including during the litigation of any objection to any Claim or Interest or during the appeal relating to such objection.  Notwithstanding any provision otherwise in the Plan, a Claim that has been expunged from the Claims Register, but that either is subject to appeal or has not been the subject of a Final Order, shall be deemed to be estimated at zero dollars, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.  In the event that the Bankruptcy Court estimates any contingent or unliquidated Claim or Interest, that estimated amount shall constitute a maximum limitation on such Claim or Interest for all purposes under the Plan (including for purposes of distributions), and the relevant Reorganized Debtor may elect to pursue any supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate distribution on such Claim or Interest.</p>
<h2>E. Adjustment to Claims or Interests without Objection</h2>
<p>Any  duplicate  Claim  or  Interest  or  any  Claim  or  Interest  that  has  been  paid,  satisfied, amended, or superseded may be adjusted or expunged on the Claims Register by the Reorganized Debtors  without  the  Reorganized  Debtors  having  to  File  an  application,  motion,  complaint, objection, or any other legal proceeding seeking to object to such Claim or Interest and without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.  The Debtors shall provide any Holder of such a Claim or Interest with fourteen days' notice prior to the Claim or Interest being adjusted or expunged from the Claims Register as the result of a Claim or Interest being paid, satisfied, amended or superseded.</p>
<h2>F. Disallowance of Claims or Interests</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all Claims and Interests of any Entity from which property is sought by the Debtors under sections 542, 543, 550, or 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors allege is a transferee of a transfer that is avoidable under sections 522(f), 522(h), 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or 724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code shall be disallowed if:  (1) the Entity, on the one hand, and the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, on the other hand, agree or the Bankruptcy Court has determined by Final Order that such Entity or transferee is liable to turn over any property or monies under any of the aforementioned sections of the Bankruptcy Code; and (2) such Entity or transferee has failed to turn over such property by the date set forth in such agreement or Final Order.</p>
<h2>G. No Distributions Pending Allowance</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, if any portion of a Claim or Interest is a Disputed Claim or Interest, as applicable, no payment or distribution provided hereunder shall be</p>
<p>made on account of such Claim or Interest unless and until such Disputed Claim or Interest becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed Interest.</p>
<h2>H. Distributions After Allowance</h2>
<p>To the extent that a Disputed Claim or Interest ultimately becomes an Allowed Claim or Allowed  Interest,  distributions  (if  any)  shall  be  made  to  the  Holder  of  such  Allowed  Claim  or Allowed  Interest  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Plan.    On  or  as  soon  as  reasonably practicable after the next Distribution Date after the date that the order or judgment of the Bankruptcy Court allowing any Disputed Claim or Interest becomes a Final Order, the Disbursing Agent shall provide to the Holder of such Claim or Interest the distribution (if any) to which such Holder is entitled under the Plan as of the Effective Date, without any interest to be paid on account of such Claim or Interest.</p>
<h2>ARTICLE VIII.</h2>
<h2>SETTLEMENT, RELEASE, INJUNCTION, AND RELATED PROVISIONS</h2>
<h2>A. Discharge of Claims Against and Terminated Interests in Debtors</h2>
<p>Pursuant  to  section 1141(d)  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code  to  the  fullest  extent  permitted thereunder, and except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan or the Confirmation Order, the  distributions,  rights  and  treatment  that  are  provided  in  the  Plan  shall  be  in  full  and  final satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge, effective as of the Effective Date, of all Claims, Interests and Causes of Action of any nature whatsoever, including any interest accrued on Claims or Interests from and after the Petition Date, whether known or unknown, against, liabilities of, Liens  on,  obligations  of,  rights  against  and  Interests  in,  the  Debtors  or  any  of  their  assets  or properties, regardless of whether any property shall have been distributed or retained pursuant to the Plan on account of such Claims and Interests, including Causes of Action that arose before the Effective Date,  any  contingent  or  non-contingent  liability  on  account  of  representations  or warranties issued on or before the Effective Date, and all debts of the kind specified in sections 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code, in each case whether or not:  (i) a proof of claim or  Interest  based  upon  such  Claim,  debt,  right  or  Interest  is  filed  or  deemed  filed  pursuant  to section 501 of the Bankruptcy Code; (ii) a Claim or Interest based upon such Claim, debt, right or Interest is Allowed pursuant to section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code; or (3) the Holder of such a Claim or Interest has accepted the Plan.  The Confirmation Order shall be a judicial determination of  the  discharge  of  all  Claims  and  Interests  subject  to  the  Effective  Date  occurring,  except  as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan.</p>
<p>Each holder (as well as any trustee or agent on behalf of such holder) of a Claim or Interest, and any Affiliate of such holder, shall be deemed to have forever waived, released, and discharged the Debtors, to the fullest extent permitted by section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, of and from any and all Claims, Interests, rights, and liabilities that arose prior to the Effective Date.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, upon the Effective Date, all such holders of Claims and Interests and their Affiliates shall be forever precluded and enjoined, pursuant to sections 105, 524, and 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, from prosecuting or asserting any such discharged Claim or Interest. Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  nothing  in  this  section  is  intended  or  shall  be  deemed  to  (i)</p>
<p>discharge the Debtors' obligations pursuant to the Plan to Holders of Allowed Unimpaired Claims, or (ii) preclude and enjoin such Holders from enforcing such obligations.</p>
<h2>B. Release of Liens</h2>
<p>Except as otherwise provided in the New Debt Documents, the Plan, the Confirmation Order, or in any contract, instrument, release, or other agreement or document created or entered into pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date and concurrently with the applicable distributions made pursuant to the Plan, all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security interests against any property of the Debtors and their Estates shall be fully released and discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of any holder of such mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security interests shall revert to the Reorganized Debtors and their successors and assigns.  Any Holder of a Secured Claim (and the applicable agents for such  Holder)  that  has  been  satisfied  or  discharged  in  full  pursuant  to  the  Plan  shall  be authorized and directed, at the sole cost and expense of the Reorganized Debtors, to release any collateral or other property of any Debtor (including any cash collateral and possessory collateral) held by such Holder (and the applicable agents for such Holder), and to take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the Reorganized Debtors to evidence the release of such Liens and/or security interests, including the execution, delivery, and filing or recording of such releases.  The presentation or filing of the Confirmation Order to or with any federal, state,  provincial,  or  local  agency,  records  office,  or  department  shall  constitute  good  and sufficient evidence of, but shall not be required to effect, the termination of such Liens.</p>
<p>To the extent that any Holder of a Secured Claim that has been satisfied or discharged in full pursuant to the Plan, or any agent for such Holder, has filed or recorded publicly any Liens  and/or  security  interests  to  secure  such  Holder's  Secured  Claim,  then  as  soon  as practicable on or after the Effective Date, such Holder (or the agent for such Holder) shall take any and all steps requested by the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors or the New Agent that are necessary or desirable to record or effectuate the cancelation and/or extinguishment of  such  Liens  and/or security interests, including the making of any applicable filings or recordings,  and  the  Reorganized  Debtors  shall  be  entitled  to  make  any  such  filings  or recordings on such Holder's behalf.</p>
<h2>C. Releases by the Debtors</h2>

The Exculpated Parties have, and upon completion of the Plan shall be deemed to have, participated in good faith and in compliance with the applicable laws with regard to the solicitation of votes and distribution of consideration pursuant to the Plan and, therefore, are not, and on account of such distributions shall not be, liable at any time for the violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing the solicitation of acceptances or rejections of the Plan or such distributions made pursuant to the Plan.  The exculpation will be in addition to, and not in limitation of, all other releases, indemnities, exculpations and any other applicable law or rules protecting such Exculpated Parties from liability.</p>
