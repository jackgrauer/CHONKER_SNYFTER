# Debug Text Editing

## What We've Added

1. **Enhanced Debug Output**:
   - `🔤 TYPED 'X' at cell (x, y)` - When typing a character
   - `✏️ EDIT SUCCESS: Changed 'A' to 'B' at (x, y)` - When edit completes
   - `📋 COPY SUCCESS: Copied 'text' (n chars) to clipboard` - When copy works
   - `📋 PASTE SUCCESS: Pasted n characters starting at (x, y)` - When paste works

2. **Key Changes**:
   - Added `ctx.request_repaint()` after keyboard input
   - Added detailed logging for all edit operations
   - Made sure `editable_matrix` is in scope for keyboard handling

## Test Steps

```bash
cargo run
```

1. Load a PDF and click PROCESS
2. Go to Matrix tab
3. Click on a cell
4. Type a character - watch for:
   - `📝 Text event: 'a'` 
   - `🔤 TYPED 'a' at cell (x, y)`
   - `✏️ EDIT SUCCESS: Changed ' ' to 'a' at (x, y)`

5. Test Copy (Cmd+C):
   - `⌨️ Key event: C, Cmd: true`
   - `🔤 COPY KEY PRESSED`
   - `📋 COPY SUCCESS: Copied 'a' from (x, y) to clipboard`

6. Test Paste (Cmd+V):
   - `📋 PASTE EVENT DETECTED: n chars`
   - `📋 PASTING at cell (x, y): 'text'`
   - `📋 PASTE SUCCESS: Pasted n characters`

## What to Check

If you see the "TYPED" message but not "EDIT SUCCESS", then:
- The character isn't being written to the matrix
- Check if `selected_cell` is None

If you see "COPY KEY PRESSED" but not "COPY SUCCESS", then:
- The copy operation isn't completing
- Check if needs_copy is being processed

If nothing happens at all:
- Check if FocusedPane is MatrixView
- Check if events are being consumed elsewhere
