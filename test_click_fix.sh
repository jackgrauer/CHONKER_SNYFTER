echo "=== Testing Click Detection Fix ==="
echo
echo "WHAT WAS FIXED:"
echo "- Separated click detection from drag detection"
echo "- Used response.clicked() instead of relying on drag events"
echo "- Should prevent clicks being treated as drags"
echo
echo "TEST STEPS:"
echo "1. Load a PDF file"
echo "2. Click 'PROCESS' to generate character matrix"
echo "3. Click on any cell in the matrix view"
echo
echo "EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "‚úÖ Should see: 'üñ±Ô∏è CLICK DETECTED!'"
echo "‚úÖ Should see: 'üñ±Ô∏è CLICK POS: (x, y), matrix size: WxH'"
echo "‚úÖ Should see: 'üñ±Ô∏è SETTING DRAG ACTION: SingleClick(x, y)'"
echo "‚úÖ Should NOT see multiple drag events for a single click"
echo
echo "WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN TERMINAL:"
echo "- Clean click events without StartDrag/UpdateDrag/EndDrag spam"
echo "- selected_cell should change from None to Some((x, y))"
echo "- After clicking, typing should open the text edit dialog"
echo
echo "Press Ctrl+C to stop the test when done"
