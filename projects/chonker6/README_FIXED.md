# Chonker6 - Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dual Pane System Restored
- The application now properly displays both PDF and text panels side by side
- The 50-50 split is maintained
- Both panels render correctly with their background colors

### 2. ✅ Ctrl+O File Opening Works
- The file selector properly activates when pressing Ctrl+O
- File navigation with arrow keys works
- Enter key opens the selected PDF
- The file selector was already working, but the UI rendering was fixed

### 3. ✅ Kitty Terminal PDF Rendering
- PDF rendering in Kitty now works WITHOUT breaking the dual-pane UI
- The PDF is rendered AFTER the frame is drawn to avoid conflicts
- Proper type conversions fixed (u16 to u32 for pixel calculations)
- The PDF automatically fits to the left pane width

## Technical Changes Made

### Main Loop (main.rs)
- Changed from trying to return values from `terminal.draw()` to using `terminal.size()`
- Kitty PDF rendering now happens AFTER the frame is rendered
- Calculates the PDF area based on terminal dimensions

### App Structure (app.rs)
- Split Kitty rendering into two functions:
  - `render()` - Renders the frame buffer with placeholders
  - `render_pdf_with_kitty_post_frame()` - Renders the actual PDF image after frame
- Added helper methods:
  - `is_kitty_terminal()` - Check if running in Kitty
  - `has_pdf_loaded()` - Check if a PDF is loaded
- Fixed type mismatches (u16 * u32) by adding proper casts

### Rendering Logic
- For normal terminals: Renders text-based PDF info in the frame buffer
- For iTerm2: Uses inline image protocol (existing behavior)
- For Kitty: 
  1. Renders placeholder in frame buffer
  2. After frame is drawn, overlays the PDF image using Kitty graphics protocol

## How It Works Now

1. **Frame Rendering**: The dual-pane UI is rendered to the frame buffer
2. **Terminal Output**: The frame is drawn to the terminal
3. **Kitty Overlay**: If in Kitty with a PDF loaded, the image is overlaid on the left pane

This approach ensures:
- The UI structure remains intact
- All controls and navigation work properly
- PDF rendering doesn't interfere with the text panel
- The application works in all terminal types

## Testing

### In Kitty Terminal
```bash
KITTY_WINDOW_ID=1 TERM=xterm-kitty ./target/release/chonker6
```

### In Regular Terminal
```bash
./target/release/chonker6
```

## Features Working
- ✅ Dual pane display (PDF left, text right)
- ✅ Ctrl+O opens file selector
- ✅ Arrow keys navigate files/pages
- ✅ Ctrl+E extracts text from PDF
- ✅ Tab switches between panels
- ✅ Text editing with selection modes
- ✅ Clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste)
- ✅ PDF rendering in Kitty with auto-fit
- ✅ Fallback to text display in non-Kitty terminals
