CASE ID # 51-4186195, SOCIAL SECURITY # 165-72-8356*
Dear County Assistance Office,
At an in-person meeting with CAO personnel last week, I learned my last attempt to update my
application for SNAP was unsuccessful because CAO personnel scanned my documents
improperly, and I misunderstood what information was requested in NOTICE ID # 138027128.
Attached are:
DOCUMENT A: NOTICE ID # 138027128, in which CAO requested additional financial
information;
DOCUMENT B: Proof of last payment for writing work, consisting of an invoice;
DOCUMENT C: Further confirmation of payment via all information available from the account
transaction, which occurred via Venmo.
DOCUMENT D: A signed letter confirming two additional, non-employment related income
sources. My family partially financially supports me in the amount of $200 to $300 per month,
and my roommate, who pays me $300 to rent a room in my home.
Please let me know if you require any additional information or documentation.
-Jordan Grauer
