# Test Text Editing NOW

## What's Changed
- **LOG panel is now VISIBLE by default** at the bottom of the window
- Debug messages will appear there in real-time

## Test Steps

1. **Run the app**: `cargo run`
2. **Look at the bottom** - You should see a LOG panel with:
   ```
   🐹 CHONKER 5 Ready!
   📌 Character Matrix Engine: PDF → Char Matrix → Vision Boxes → Text Mapping
   ```

3. **Load a PDF** and click **PROCESS**
   - Watch for extraction messages in the log

4. **Click on the Matrix tab**
   - Look for: `🎯 Matrix view focused`
   - The tab should show: `[MATRIX] ⌨️`

5. **Click on any cell in the matrix**
   - Look for: `🖱️ Cell (x, y) selected`

6. **Type any character (like 'X')**
   - Look for: `📝 Opening text edit dialog for cell...`
   - The tab should show: `[MATRIX] ⌨️ ✏️`
   - **A dialog should appear!**

## What to Look For in the LOG

Success flow:
```
🎯 Matrix view focused
🖱️ Cell (5, 10) selected  
📝 Opening text edit dialog for cell (5, 10) with content: 'X'
```

If you don't see these messages, we know exactly where the problem is!
