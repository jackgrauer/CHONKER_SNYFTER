# CHONKER TODO

## Current Issues

### üêõ Drag-and-Drop Not Working
- **Issue**: Click-and-drag functionality implemented but not responding in QWebEngineView
- **Status**: JavaScript is loading (syntax errors fixed) but drag events not firing
- **Code Location**: `chonker.py` lines 1968-2050 (JavaScript drag implementation)

#### Potential Solutions:
1. Debug JavaScript execution in QWebEngineView console
2. Try Qt-native drag implementation instead of JavaScript
3. Add console.log statements to trace event flow
4. Check if contenteditable is interfering with mouse events
