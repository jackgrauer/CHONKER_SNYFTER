Introduction 

Even though there has been in depth discussion of many particular 
argumentation  schemes  (see,  for  example,  Macagno  and  Walton 
2017;  Walton  2000;  Walton  1999;  Walton  1996),  there  has  also 
been  a  lament  that  there  is  little  to  no  theory  underpinning  the 
notion  of  an  argumentation  scheme  (Dove  and  Nussbaum  2018).
Here  I  shall  present  and  discuss  the  consequences  of  some  very 
minimalist theories of what argumentation schemes are.",sentences_11-21,"text, paragraph",688,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

tion  schemes  and  not  a  general  theory  of  schemes,  though,  of 
course, the nature of schemes will have consequences for a more 
general theory.
Without an adequate theory of the nature or ontol-
ogy  of  schemes  we  cannot  hope  to  achieve  an  acceptable  and 
firmly grounded general theory of schemes.
Such a general theory 
might also include a categorization of schemes, a means of distin-
guishing  good  schemes  from  bad  ones,  an  articulation  of  how  to 
use  schemes  to  aid  in  other  aspects  of  argumentation  theory,  etc.
Regardless,  I  shall  only  briefly  touch  on  a  more  general,  yet  still 
quite simple, theory of argumentation schemes towards the end of

typical  desiderata  theorists  hope  to  achieve  by  appealing  to  argu-

shall hypothesize that instead of taking the results of section 3 and 
4  as  a  reductio  of  the  minimalist  theories  (or  the  underlying  as-
sumption), we should instead focus less on schemes and more on 
the component parts.
What are argument schemes? 

According to Douglas Walton, Chris Reed, and Fabrizio Macagno, 
in their book, Argumentation Schemes:  
 
 A simple theory of argument schemes  541

Argumentation  schemes  are  forms  of  argument  (structures  of  in-
ference)  that  represent  structures  of  common  types  of  arguments 
used  in  everyday  discourse,  as  well  as  in  special  contexts  like 
those  of  legal  argumentation  and  scientific  argumentation  (2008, 
p, 1).",sentences_23-33,"text, paragraph",779,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

Though  I  am  not  sure  what  it  means  for  a  form  of  argument  to 
represent a structure of a common type of argument, we can start 
with the notion that argument schemes are at the very least forms 
of argument.
Indeed, their very next sentence is: “They include the 
deductive and inductive forms of argument that we are already so 
familiar with in logic …” (Walton, Reed, and Macagno, 2008, p.
1; see also, p.
Though perhaps not wholly explicit, Christoph 
Lumer (2011), David Hitchcock, (2017), and Manfred Kienpoint-
ner,  (2018),  all,  at  least  by  the  examples  they  give,  endorse  this 
last  claim.
Hence,  whatever  argument  schemes  are,  it  is  as  least 
true that: 
  (1) Logical forms are a type of argument scheme.",sentences_28-38,"text, paragraph",758,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

Sup-
pose  an  argument  is  a  set  of  a  set  of  propositions  and  another 
proposition.
Argument  schemes  are  the  forms  of  arguments  or 
schematic  arguments.
Propositional  functions  are  the  forms  of 
propositions or schematic propositions.
Hence, the simplest theory 
of the nature of argument schemes would be: 
  T1:  An  argument  scheme  is  a  set  of  a  set  of  propositional 
functions and another propositional function.
Propositional functions 

What exactly is a propositional function? According to Russell and 
Whitehead: 
  By a ‘propositional function’ we mean something which contains 
a variable x, and expresses a proposition as soon as a value is as-
signed to x.",sentences_34-44,"text, paragraph",767,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

the  fact  that  it  is  ambiguous:  it  contains  a  variable  of  which  the 
value is unassigned.
(Russell & Whitehead 1925, p.
Assuming  there  is  a  difference  between  the  things  that  express 
propositions (presumably some sort of sentence in some language) 
and propositions themselves, then it is hard to make both sentences 
of  what  Russell  and  Whitehead  say  compatible,  since  the  first 
makes  them  the  sort  of  thing  that  express  propositions,  while  the 
second makes them a kind of ambiguous proposition.",sentences_41-51,"text, paragraph",718,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

on ambiguity in terms of a variable with an unassigned value does 
not help.
A variable is itself an expression and so the propositions 
themselves would not contain variables.
The question is what does 
the variable express or represent? Presumably, some sort of hole or 
gap or incompleteness in a partial proposition.
I suspect one could go either way with a theory of propositional 
functions  and  so  the  ontology  of  argument  schemes—schemes 
could  be  (i)  sets  of  expressions  with  at  least  one  variable  or  (ii) 
sets of incomplete propositions.",sentences_45-55,"text, paragraph",581,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

argue, firstly, that if one thinks it is possible for different expres-
sions  to  express  the  same  scheme,  then  since  the  expressions  are 
different  and  the  scheme  the  same,  the  scheme  had  better  not  be 
composed of expressions.
For example, if one thinks that ‘Anyone 
who respects Bob ought to respect George; x respects Bob; hence x 
ought  to  respect  George’  is  just  another  way  of  expressing  the 
same scheme as ‘If x respects Bob, then x ought to respect George; 
x respects Bob; so x ought to respect George’ then one will have to 
opt for propositional functions as incomplete propositions or prop-
ositions  with  ‘holes.",sentences_47-57,"text, paragraph",705,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

via  sentences  with  variables  in  them  to  represent  the  ‘holes’  and 
yet  it  appears  that  different  such  expressions  can  represent  the 
same incomplete proposition.
Secondly, if one takes seriously that 
argument  schemes  are  arguments  with  ‘holes’  in  them,  and  that 
arguments are composed of propositions, as many are inclined to 
do, then the ‘holes’ will be in the constituent propositions, and so 
propositional functions will be propositions with ‘holes’ in them.

ence.

one  variable,  such  that  when  each  variable  in  each  expres-
sion is replaced with an equivalent value, every member of 
the class expresses the same proposition.
As ungainly as this definition might at first appear, assuming that

of  different  expressions  with  variables  ultimately  picking  out  the

arguments  because  they  are  composed  of  schematic  propositions.
Perhaps the inelegance can be avoided by holding that arguments 
are themselves composed of expressions rather than propositions.
Of the three ontological candidates for arguments, viz, proposi-
tions, acts, or expressions, expressions is probably the least popu-
lar choice amongst theorists.

function can be used with different domains for the variables.

Critical questions? 

One  might  object  that  T1  and  T2  do  not  capture  all  given  argu-
mentation  schemes  on  the  grounds  that  in  many  cases,  schemes, 
especially defeasible schemes, are presented along with a series of 
critical  questions  and  T1  and  T2  include  no  mention  of  critical 
questions at all.
Are critical questions part of schemes or not?   
One  standard  answer  is  “no.",sentences_178-188,"text, paragraph",661,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

questions,  but  the  questions  are  not  part  of  the  schemes  them-
selves,  but  rather  provide  guidance  for  the  proper  evaluation  of 
instances  of  the  schemes.
For  example,  Walton,  Reed,  and 
Macagno  write:  “The  two  elements  together,  the  argumentation 
scheme and the matching critical questions, are used to evaluate a 
given  argument  in  a  particular  case  …”  (2008,  p.

As  an  aid  to  evaluation  of  the  inference  in  an  argument  fitting  a

of getting students to even recognize and utilize schemes, propose 
a  strategy  for  argument  assessment  that  generalizes  the  critical 
questions  so  as  to  be  completely  independent  of  any  particular 
argument scheme.
Indeed, examination of the critical questions should lead one to 
believe that they are not constitutive of the scheme since the criti-
cal  questions  are  not  setting  out  conditions  for  an  instance  of  a 
particular  scheme  being  an  instance  of  the  scheme.
For  example, 
consider  the  question,  “Are  there  other  events  that  would  more 
reliably  account  for  the  sign?”,  in  a  typical  argument  from  sign.

Argument taxonomy 

If schemes are types of arguments, then arguments that instantiate 
a particular scheme would be arguments of that type.
Then, if we 
had  a  practically  manageable  table  of  argument  types,  we  might 
end up with a useful taxonomy of arguments.",sentences_233-243,"text, table",680,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

many  more  schemes  that  count  as  examples  of  argument  from

argument schemes—there are just too many ways of arguing that 
overlap with each other to get a complete and workable taxonomy.

Thirdly, the nature and utility of critical questions are themselves a

Consider: 
  S31: All X are Y and some X are Z, so some Z are Y.

  S32: X said Y in domain Z and X is an expert in domain Z, so 
it is highly likely that Y.

and  the  invention  of  one’s  own  (hopefully  stronger)  arguments.
More  generally,  focusing  on  propositional  functions  rather  than 
schemes makes one more open to alternative combinations of such 
functions  rather  than  trying  to  subsume  every  argument  into  a 
fixed set of schemes.",sentences_565-575,"text, table",761,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

Despite  significant  and  important  analyses  of  many  particular 
schemes, which I interpret as attempts to understand the argumen-
tative force of such propositional functions as ‘X is an expert in Z’ 
or  ‘A  is  a  sign  of  B’  or  ‘Act  X  has  value  Y,’  etc.
,  there  has  been 
little  success  in  generating  an  acceptable  underlying  theory  of 
argumentation  schemes.
T1  or  T2  are  both  simple  and  elegant 
theories  of  the  nature  of  argument  schemes  that  encompass  all 
identified schemes in the literature and all logical forms and many 
more potential schemes besides.",sentences_568-578,"text, table",631,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

schemes  in  a  simple  way,  however,  is  a  tremendous  proliferation 

 
18 A or B, so A—what is the missing function?  ‘Not B’.
You sure?  Why not ‘If 
B, then A’ or ‘If A or B, then A,’ or ‘The probability of B is less than one in a 
trillion,’ or…   
19 I suspect that at least some critical questions are trying to point toward ade-
quacy conditions for acceptable uses of particular propositional functions.

T1  or  T2  precludes  schemes  from  fulfilling  any  of  the  outcomes 
theorists  have  hoped  to  gain  from  schemes,  such  as  providing  a 
manageable taxonomy of arguments, aiding in enthymeme recon-
struction,  evaluating  or  generating  arguments,  or  describing  par-
ticular sub-groups’ reasoning processes.
Indeed, if no other poten-

more radical consequence is that argumentation schemes are gen-
erally theoretically irrelevant.",sentences_577-587,"text, paragraph",577,2025-06-27T17:22:34.286922+00:00

defenders  of  argument  schemes  to  provide  an  account  of  their 
nature  that  could  be  part  of  a  general,  non-arbitrary,  theory  of 
schemes and yet still gives them a theoretically significant role to 
play.
Failing that, should we then abandon T1 or T2? No.
We should 
abandon the attempt to achieve the desired outcomes, if they really 
are  desired,  via  a  theory  of  schemes.

ble and theoretically significant remains to be seen.

theory of the nature of argument schemes beyond T1 or T2.

Foreword

The movement of teams in professional sports is often referred to as the
""sports franchise game.
"" To mayors of major cities across the country,
the efforts to keep or obtain a professional sports franchise is no game.",sentences_11-21,"text, table",756,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

sports-related struggles-to keep the Redskins playing within the Dis-
trict and to keep alert to the possibility of obtaining a baseball franchise
to replace the twice-departed Senators.
What we are keenly aware of, and what Professor Shropshire addresses
in this book, is that a professional sports franchise is no longer the finan-
cial panacea for what ails a city.
We can no longer pay any price to call a
professional sports franchise our own because an often extraordinarily
high price is what the owners of America's sports franchises are demand-
ing.
If we do not pay the price they demand, they tell us they will move
to the suburbs or to another city.",sentences_15-25,"text, paragraph",734,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

some owners of sports franchises is the type of difficult decision that I
had to grapple with during my tenure as mayor of Washington, D.
Our
cities today are confronted with a myriad of problems and have only lim-
ited financial resources to allocate.
Our priorities must be readjusted.
This concise book causes the reader to take a step back and to re-
consider sport-related expenditures.
It also raises the issue of the social
obligation that some owners may find that they have for America's inner
cities.
The mayors of American cities are confronted with a prisoner's di-
lemma of sorts.
If no mayor succumbs to the demands of a franchise
shopping for a new home then the teams will stay where they are.",sentences_22-32,"text, paragraph",776,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

however, is unlikely to happen because if Mayor A is not willing to pay
the price, Mayor B may think it is advantageous to open up the city's
wallet.
Then to protect his or her interest, Mayor A often ends up paying
the demanded price.

I do love sports.
The presence of a team within the city limits is
important.

Washington Redskins.
My husband has been involved in a number of

probably the most important thrust of the book, which I wholeheartedly
agree with, is the need to rethink our priorities when it comes to spend-

all, not just those who happen to be sports fans and can afford to attend
the games.
It is the duty of civic leaders to protect the interests of all of
their citizens.

Chicago and Philadelphia are now the only two cities in the United States
that can boast about having a full complement of professional sports
franchises-football, baseball, basketball, and hockey-playing within
their city limits.
Other major cities have lost one or more of their fran-
chises to the suburbs or to other cities.
Until fairly recently, the owner
of the team typically also owned the downtown stadium.
For example,
in 1950 the Cleveland Indians was the only major league franchise that
played in a publicly owned facility.
2 A lot has changed since 1960 when
a trip to the ballpark meant a trip downtown.",sentences_53-63,"text, paragraph",746,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

to a publicly financed facility in the suburbs.
Today the trip is often too
expensive for many individuals and families, particularly those residents
of the inner city, to make at all.

The reasons behind the ""fleeing franchise"" syndrome are simple.
More
cities that are already equipped with stadiums and arenas crave sports
franchises than there are available franchises.
As this is being written
there are plans in the works or construction underway for at least a dozen
new sports facilities.
A sampling of future construction plans are shown
in Table 1.

models, should there be a similar burden on the owners of these fran-

a societal obligation, then shouldn't the employers, the team owners, ac-
cept the same obligation? Rarely has that obligation reached the level
of popular discussion that the obligation of the individual athlete has.

a card game they call Tegwar, ""the exciting game without any rules.

Why do teams move? The obvious and most accepted reason is finan-
cial survival.
But, as will be illustrated, financial survival is not the sole
motivation.
Sport is a unique business.
Moving a sports franchise is not
an easy thing to do, even when a franchise is in dire financial straits
and good business acumen would dictate a move to a fresh venue.

Finley, or Bill Veeck he may have trouble gaining league approval for a
move not for business reasons but merely because the commissioner or

A sports franchise owner has limited options compared with the pro-
prietors of other businesses.
Like operators of fast-food franchises such
as McDonald's, a sports franchise owner usually cannot just pack up and
relocate when such a move makes good economic sense to the owner.

Football teams split ticket sales, or
gate receipts, with 60 percent going to the home team and 40 percent
to the visiting team; baseball's split is approximately 80-90 percent to
the home team and 10-20 percent to the visitors.

local television contracts for the broadcast of games of individual teams.

more desirable location.
There is still controversy over just how ""local"" are revenues from

sion of both studies was that the financial impact was a substantial plus
for the metropolitan Philadelphia area.
The initial study received national recognition for its use of the multi-
plier technique and has served as a model for subsequent studies con-
ducted for other municipalities by other researchers.
Shils utilized what
he and Wharton Professor of Finance and Economics F.
Gerard Adams
describe as a ""conservative"" multiplier to determine the economic im-
pact of the Philadelphia professional sports franchises.

cipients of the initial dollar are somewhat likely to spend it again in that

Several different types of multipliers may be used.
The Bureau of Eco-
nomic Analysis of the U.
Department of Commerce periodically cal-
culates and publishes Regional Impact Multipliers (RIMs).

the dilemma that many cities confront, he concludes that the num-
ber of ""leisure"" dollars that individuals in a community spend on such
entertainment-type activities is fixed.

of a sports franchise in a community at best would cause a shift in leisure
spending but probably would not create an increase in spending.

Orleans, and Denver.
17 Perhaps even more significantly, Baade has de-
termined further that there is a ""lower rate of economic growth in cities
that adopt a sports-development strategy than [in cities with] develop-
ment growth of other sorts.

Professor William J.
Hunter of Marquette University, in ""Economic
Impact Studies: Inaccurate, Misleading, and Unnecessary,""28 examines
the validity of impact studies generally.
He harshly questions whether
impact studies should be given much credence at all or, as he puts it by
quoting Mark Twain, ""It's not what we don't know that hurts.

know that just ain't true.

a multiplier will always make the most expensive project look better
than the less expensive alternative.
Hunter calls this the ""Taj Mahal Syn-
drome.
"" ~o According to his analysis, if a municipality debates whether
to construct a new stadium or to repair the old one to attract a sports
franchise, use of the multiplier will always indicate that new construc-
tion is the more appealing alternative.
~lBecause construction is more
expensive than renovation, more dollars will be multiplied to make con-
struction the alternative with a more positive overall financial impact.

Curiously, setting aside the former
Oakland Raiders for a moment, San Francisco was one of the three

referred to as the modern-day relocations because they were the first

American League Red Sox, Boston's other major league baseball team.

team is determined by the key sales factor cited in the old real estate

finished in second place.

churned an additional $25.

Neither the city nor the franchise could foresee at that point, however,
that this success would not go on forever.

stadiums to either lure or keep teams, and private ownership of stadi-

Dodgers owner O'Malley was determined to rectify the aged stadium
problem.
14 He was able to garner a unique level of support from his fel-

Around that same
time, Christopher stated,""They'll [the Giants] add at least $25 million
a year to our economy,"" thus positioning San Francisco in the fran-
chise game.

The league was not necessarily trying to give O'Malley any additional
leverage.
Its main concern was controlling the cost of team travel for
all league members.

Francisco Seals.

A municipality's power to exercise
eminent domain is generally outlined by state statutes.
Such statutes also
set forth the process that a state or city must follow to condemn property

Could a city condemn, for example, a General Motors plant, preventing
a move to cheaper labor in Latin America? 56 California Supreme Court
ChiefJustice Rose Bird raised the following related queries:

[I]f a rock concert impresario, after some years of producing concerts in a mu-
nicipal stadium, decides to move his productions to another city, may the city
condemn his business, including his contracts with the rock stars, in order to
keep the concerts at the stadium? If a small business that rents a siorefront on
land originally taken by the city for a redevelopment project decides to move
to another city in order to expand, may the city take the business and force it
to stay at its original location? Maya city condemn any business that decides to
seek greener pastures elsewhere under the unlimited interpretation of eminent
domain law that the majority appear to approve? 57

eminent domain power to be exercised for the recreational welfare of its

is that Indianapolis was able to respond to the self-imposed pressure to
avoid the reputation of having built a white elephant.
The city moved
forward confidently and aggressively.
There was little if any public outcry
over the expenditure, probably because of the way it was financed: two
private donations and bonds that were paid back via a county-wide hotel
tax and a county-wide food and beverage tax.

a low stadium rental rate; a guarantee of a minimum of 40,000 ticket

offices; and, finally, a $15-million low-interest loan so that Irsay could

epigraph at the beginning of this chapter, was acting much more aggres-

Some factors indicate that Irsay was initially sincere in trying to keep
the Colts in Baltimore.
One of the drawbacks of Baltimore was a city

ordinance that did not allow Sunday games to begin before 2: 00 P.
The

would often refuse to broadcast Colts games because of the late hour.

However, even Irsay's success in lifting the Sunday start time restriction
was not enough to keep the Colts in Baltimore.
A number of reports, including an interview with Mayor Schaefer, in-
dicated that Irsay ""promised"" that he would notify Schaefer and give
Baltimore one last chance before he relocated.
There was, however, no
final phone call before the Mayflower vans were loaded up on that snowy,
foggy night.

The Lesson Learned by Baltimore

Mter the Colts moved to Indianapolis, Baltimore was not prepared to
risk losing another franchise.
The city wanted to avoid the perception
that Indianapolis, with arguably few attractions other than sports, had
absconded with Baltimore's ""major-league city"" status along with its foot-
ball team.",sentences_1036-1046,"text, paragraph",738,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

the Colts and barely holding onto the baseball Orioles, was rapidly mov-
ing back to being recognized only as the toilet stop on the drive between
Washington, D.
, and Philadelphia.
The Orioles had played in Memorial Stadium - the same aging facility
that Irsay had complained about-since 1954, when they moved from
St.
Mter the Colts left, Baltimore-and the State of Maryland-
began to debate whether to build one stadium or two.
One park would
be exclusively for baseball, and the second would be designed to ""at-
tract"" a new football franchise.
In the end, Oriole Park at Camden Yards was constructed in down-
town Baltimore at a cost of$105.
An additional $99 million was
needed to acquire the eighty-five-acre site.",sentences_1043-1053,"text, paragraph",779,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

ers of the stadium again pointed to jobs, revenues, and economic impact
as the key advantages.
The construction of the stadium created 2,858
jobs, $54.
5 million in salaries, and $11 million in state and local taxes.
The economic impact on the region, once the stadium was operational,
was predicted to be $15.

incided with the thirty-year bonds used to finance the construction.

The other stadium, intended for football, would be built if the city re-
ceived an expansion franchise or a franchise through other means.

would be a 65,000- to 70,000-seat natural grass stadium built adjacent
to Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which would be financed with public
funds and would boast one hundred luxury boxes and 7,500 club seats.

marketable image possible, cities that boast of increased regional size
also increase their television markets, an important selling point for NFL
owners, who all share in the broadcast revenues.

Like Baltimore,
St.
Louis lost an NFL franchise.
Its primary problem when it was the
home of the Cardinals was the small size of its stadium, which accommo-
dated 51,000 fans.
36 For the last ten years in St.
Louis, before moving to
Phoenix, the Cardinals played to a 90-percent capacity crowd averaging
46,000.

Washington, D.
, was among the group of cities-along with St.
Peters-
burg, Orlando, and Buffalo-that were passed over when Major League
Baseball expansion franchises were granted to Miami and Denver in
1991.
When these cities lost their bids for expansion teams, several an-
nounced publicly that they were resorting to what the New York Times
called ""Plan 2"" - an attempt to lure an existing franchise from another
location.

franchise relocations (quoted above) received wide attention.",sentences_1093-1103,"text, paragraph",792,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

a franchise.
Expansion involves no moving vans in the night, rarely re-
sults in lawsuits, and avoids the drastic lease concessions that are made
in desperate attempts to keep an established franchise owner happy.
The primary expenditure that the expansion franchise seeker (usually a
group of investor-owners) must make is the franchise fee.
The individual
or group must show that it has sufficient operating capital to support the
venture.
The owners, not the host city, make the franchise fee payment,
and in 1991 the fee for a baseball expansion franchise was $95 million.
The problem is that expansion does not occur frequently, yet demand
for teams is always high.",sentences_1099-1109,"text, paragraph",740,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

have a franchise, all of its hopes should not be invested solely in the ex-
pansion option.
Washington, D.
, is an interesting city to consider here because the
District has pursued an expansion baseball franchise for so long.
The city
actually has had two baseball franchises- both named the Senators-
and has lost both.
The longing for a replacement continues to grow.
The first Senators franchise was a charter member of the American
League.

Rangers in 1972.",sentences_1108-1118,"text, table",682,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

then-desirable attendance goal of two million fans, and the team's final
home game was forfeited when fans rushed the field and tore up the sod
for souvenirs.
This two-time loser image has not helped Washington in
its efforts to obtain a new baseball franchise.
There are other barriers hampering the District's expansion efforts as
well.
In 1971, when the second Senators departed, the D.
metropolitan
area had a population of 2.
9 million people, and its average household
income was 29 percent above the national average.

like many American urban centers, recovering from racial strife and re-
cent riots.",sentences_1115-1125,"text, paragraph",684,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

Washingtonians seeking a new baseball franchise have made it clear
that much has changed in the two decades since the last team departed.
The population has increased by one million.
The disposable income of
Washingtonians has increased from 29 percent to 49 percent.
5

Despite this favorable change, a major barrier that Washington has
struggled to overcome is the success of the Baltimore Orioles discussed
in the last chapter.
It has been estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the
crowd that attends Orioles games are residents of Washington, D.
As
might be expected, about this same percentage makes up the television
viewing audience for the Orioles.",sentences_1121-1131,"text, paragraph",656,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

Another major hinderance to Washington's expansion chances has
been the absence of an ownership group that could show that financing
was in place.
This lack of a viable single or group investor became clear
when the San Francisco Giants were available in 1992 and apparently no
party was able to seize the moment for the District.
As the deadline for a Major League Baseball expansion decision ap-
proached in May 1990, since there was no individual or group inves-
tors in place, an alternative plan was proposed.
Washington business
leader Jeffrey Gildenhorn asked Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent if
he would approve of public stockholders' owning the majority of a team.",sentences_1125-1135,"text, paragraph",678,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

As the expansion decision date approached, two ownership groups
became the banner bearers for ""Senators III.
"" One group was headed by
real estate developer John Akridge, and another was led by Mark Tracz,
the owner of a minor league baseball team.
12 At one point the two groups
considered merging, hoping to increase their chances of landing a team.
They probably viewed the Akridge group as providing the majority of
the capital and the other group, with the minor league franchise experi-
ence, as providing the baseball operational expertise.
Initially the fran-
chise probably would have played in RFK Stadium, the home of Sena-

Can Legislation Create Franchise Stability?

The major concern that the District has had in more recent years, how-
ever, has been the fate of the existing primary tenant in RFK Stadium,
the Washington Redskins.
Their owner, Jack Kent Cooke, announced
before the beginning of the 1992 football season that he was planning
to build a new stadium in Alexandria, Virginia, in 1994.
Cooke's an-
nouncement led Washington, D.
, Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly to make
two memorable pronouncements.
The first, in reacting to the initial an-
nouncement by Cooke: ""as the youngsters would say, Mr.
Cooke has
dissed the District of Columbia.",sentences_1200-1210,"text, paragraph",734,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

continue to take a strong negotiating stance and that she would make
no further concessions to Cooke to keep the Redskins in place, Kelly
proclaimed that she would not ""allow our good community to be steam-
rolled by.
a billionaire bully.
"" 21
This was an extraordinarily tough time for a politician to take such a
stance.
First, this was not just any team; the Redskins were the reigning
Super Bowl champions.
Second, the District had just missed out-yet
again-on being granted that third chance at supporting a baseball fran-
chise.
Finally, if the Redskins did leave, there would be no major league
franchise playing in RFK Stadium or within the District of Columbia.",sentences_1206-1216,"text, paragraph",707,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

Another not uncommon occurrence when there is a battle for a fran-
chise is the introduction of remedial legislation.
The Maryland legisla-
tion described in the previous chapter was an attempt to provide a city
with the specific legal power to prevent a franchise from departing.
23

With a franchise relocation dispute in the nation's legislative headquar-
ters, proposed relocation legislation was inevitable.

This type of legislation has also been introduced at the federal level.

attempts to pass legislation designed to protect communities that sup-
ported their franchises, by setting forth specific conditions to be met

to Congress, introduced legislation to keep the Redskins in the District.

level.

Federal legislation specifically aimed at professional sports is rare.
Hearings are more frequent than actual legislation.
As Donald Fehr, the
head of the Major League Baseball Players Association has described it,
""Essentially sports hearings are about publicity.
They have not been very
substantive.
""28 The major legislation on the books is the 1961 legisla-
tion exempting much of network sports broadcasting from the antitrust
laws.
29 The NFL lobbied for this legislation to allow that league to nego-
tiate television contracts as a single entity and to pool revenues.
Basket-
ball, baseball, and hockey benefit from this law as well.
Later, Congress
passed legislation allowing the AFL-NFL merger to occur without vio-
lating the antitrust laws.",sentences_1225-1235,"text, paragraph",757,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

Baseball also enjoys a higher level of freedom from scrutiny from anti-
trust laws because of a 1922 judicially created exemption from the anti-
trust laws.
31 The courts have basically said that because of this 1922 de-
cision, the antitrust laws do not apply to baseball unless Congress passes
legislation to the contrary.
So football, basketball, and hockey through legislation - and base-
ball through its Court-created antitrust exemption-all have reason to
be concerned about the special power the u.
Congress holds over
them.
This situation has led to some interesting interaction between the
leagues and Congress on the relocation issue.",sentences_1230-1240,"text, paragraph",649,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

Author David Harris described one such exchange when Commis-
sioner Pete Rozelle of the NFL was seeking federal legislation in 1966 to
enable the AFL and NFL to merge.
The support of Representative Hale
Boggs of Louisiana was essential to the passing of the legislation.
Harris
reports the exchange as follows:

""Well, Pete,"" Boggs offered, ""it looks great.
""
""Great, Hale,"" Rozelle answered, ""that's great.
""
'just for the record,"" Boggs continued, ""I assume we can say the franchise for
New Orleans is firm?""

finally answered, ""why don't you just go back and check with the owners.
I'll hold
things up here until you get back.
""
Now it was Rozelle's turn to go silent for a moment.
""That's all right, Hale,""
he finally offered.
""You can count on their approval.

Less than an hour later, the NFL had its merger exemption.
Three weeks later,
the freshly merged football business added its first expansion franchise, the New
Orleans Saints.

All good intentions duly noted, the most striking argument against
this type of legislation is the invasion on the individual business rights
of the owners and leagues.
Senator John Danforth acknowledged this
reality in the hearings regarding his legislation and offered the following
justification:

Normally, the Congress would not concern itselfwith the movement of one busi-
ness - a factory, for example - from one community to a second community, but
a sports team is different from the normal business.
A sports team is closely iden-
tified with the community itself.

community, the identity of the community, and the spirit of the community.",sentences_1254-1264,"text, paragraph",702,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00

This ""difference"" between a sports franchise and a factory or other
conventional business has not been enough for any of the federal legis-
lation to be passed.
All of the proposed bills have failed.

agreement, and the team will remain in the city for the time being, as

were not sure, one felt uncomfortable answering the question, and two

72 Chapter 8

The true value of sports to our cities cannot be measured.
When con-
fronted with options regarding a stadium, franchise, or event, a city's
choices and decisions must depend on the complete circumstances and
an objective consideration of the actual value of sports.
Some of the
values that are typically espoused fall into Tunis's broad category of the
""Great Sports Myth.
"" Instead of such myths, caution and true perspec-
tive must take control as America's cities continue to pursue sports fran-
chises, stadiums, arenas, and events.

to relocate his then-dormant USFL franchise to the stadium.
In yet another

See Gottlieb, ""Trump Cleared to Build Domed Sports

This book was set in Baskerville and Eras typefaces.
Baskerville was designed by
John Baskerville at his private press in Birmingham, England, in the eighteenth
century.
The first typeface to depart from oldstyle typeface design, Baskerville
has more variation between thick and thin strokes.",sentences_2482-2492,"text, paragraph",633,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00
9a022532-f3dc-4224-a7f6-567bdafca4e0,_OceanofPDF.com_The_Sports_Franchise_Game_-_Kenneth_L_Shropshire.pdf,376,"In an effort to insure that the
thick and thin strokes of his typeface reproduced well on paper,John Baskerville
developed the first wove paper, the surface of which was much smoother than
the laid paper of the time.
The development of wove paper was partly respon-
sible for the introduction of typefaces classified as modern, which have even
more contrast between thick and thin strokes.
Eras was designed in 1969 by Studio Hollenstein in Paris for the Wagner Type-
foundry.
A contemporary script-like version of a sans-serif typeface, the letters
of Eras have a monotone stroke and are slightly inclined.
Printed on acid-free paper.",final_chunk_376,text,635,2025-06-27T17:19:51.074392+00:00
