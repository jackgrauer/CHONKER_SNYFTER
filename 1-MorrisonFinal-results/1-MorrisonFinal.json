Different theories of governance produce different definitions of the role of the board and consequently lead to different unitary choices for how to resolve one or other of the key dilemmas. For example, agency  theory naturally pushes leaders toward oppositional posturing and instrumental monitoring of  agent/executives in favor of optimizing owners' interests. On the other hand, the partnership model favors  cross-role collaboration and cooperation to optimize effectiveness at overall mission attainment often at the  expense of efficient monitoring and auditing of agent/executive management.

Each condition is characterized by distinct relationship  opportunities and challenges. For example, in high trust/low distrust (quadrant 3) relationships – the one  that seems ideal from a traditional perspective – actors have high confidence in each other and no reason to  suspect each other. Opportunities abound and partners readily pursue common aims. Many positive  experiences aggregate and solidify through reinforcing feedback loops. Interdependence expands and  widens. Appreciation, support and encouragement flourish. The trusting party is likely to identify with the  values of the trusted creating intimacy, social capitol, shared risk taking and innovation. Parties are vigilant  at interceding to restore trust when it is threatened. However, significant challenges emerge directly from  these opportunities. All too often evidence of bad behavior and ill intent is judged suspect or rationalized  away. Real threats are minimized or ignored in the name of preserving trust, which cuts off natural, useful,  and necessary emergence of distrust. The capacity to address inevitable threats is diminished. Contrary to  what might be expected and welcomed by one who holds a traditional view of trust and distrust, the potential  for organizational dysfunction is significant when conditions are characterized by high trust/low distrust. Organizational complexity, role conflict, ambiguity, and the existence of greed and fear in human nature  dictate that low distrust is a risky condition especially when paired with high trust. High trust/low distrust  conditions inure actors to real threats especially from close partners.

A multifaceted approach to trust and distrust represents a chosen strategy for  minimizing expected undesired conduct and leveraging expected desired conduct. For example, in the case  of nonprofit governance, trust (e.g., hope, faith, confidence, assurance, initiative) may define the facets of  a relationship that effectively address issues of mission-based effectiveness and innovation, while distrust "},"pages_id":[4],"bbox":{"x0":86.28218,"y0":618.42755,"x1":556.38556,"y1":717.2637}},{"id":42,"kind":{"block_type":"TextBlock","text":"\n(fear, skepticism, cynicism, watchfulness, vigilance) may define the facets of the same relationship that effectively address issues of resource efficiency, budgeting, auditing, etc."},"pages_id":[5],"bbox":{"x0":57.28824,"y0":73.337364,"x1":529.1218,"y1":97.514114}},{"id":43,"kind":{"block_type":"TextBlock","text":"Table 1 represents Lewicki, McAllister and Bies's integration of trust and distrust, and this author's  interpretation of traditional vs. paradox perspectives.

In the case of the false dilemmas of  legitimacy vs. efficiency as well as conflict and monitoring vs. cooperation and collaboration, it is possible  to transcend an either/or proposition by reframing the classic view of governance from one based on roles,  responsibilities and structures to one based on social competence (Bresser & Millonig, 2003; Deephouse,  1996; Di Maggio & Powell, 1983; Suchman, 1995)."},"pages_id":[6],"bbox":{"x0":85.48415,"y0":225.91295,"x1":559.99097,"y1":350.54337}},{"id":50,"kind":{"block_type":"Title","level":2,"text":"REFERENCES"},"pages_id":[6],"bbox":{"x0":86.2419,"y0":364.10992,"x1":160.42226,"y1":375.2674}},{"id":51,"kind":{"block_type":"TextBlock","text":"Alexander, J.
