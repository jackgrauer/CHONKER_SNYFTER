echo "=== Final Click Detection Test ==="
echo
echo "WHAT WE FIXED:"
echo "1. Removed nested ScrollArea that was consuming events"
echo "2. Separated click from drag detection"
echo "3. Use drag_released without is_dragging to detect clicks"
echo
echo "TEST SEQUENCE:"
echo "1. Load a PDF and click PROCESS"
echo "2. Click on a cell (don't drag)"
echo
echo "EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "✅ Should see: '🖱️ CLICK DETECTED (via drag_released)!'"
echo "✅ Should see: '🖱️ SETTING DRAG ACTION: SingleClick(x, y)'"
echo "✅ Should see: '🎮 HANDLING DRAG ACTION: SingleClick(x, y)'"
echo "✅ Should see: '🖱️ CELL SELECTED: (x, y)'"
echo
echo "THEN:"
echo "3. Type any character (e.g., 'X')"
echo "✅ Should see: '📝 Opening text edit dialog...'"
echo "✅ Modal dialog should appear with 'X' prefilled"
echo
echo "NO LONGER EXPECTED:"
echo "❌ Spam of UpdateDrag messages for simple clicks"
echo "❌ EndDrag overriding SingleClick"
