# Test Text Editing - Fixed!

## What We Fixed

1. **Borrow Checker Issues**: 
   - Moved edit logging outside the editable_matrix borrow scope
   - Collected edits in a vector and logged them after the match statement

2. **Enhanced Debug Output**:
   - `🔤 TYPED 'X' at cell (x, y)` - When typing
   - `✏️ EDIT SUCCESS: Changed 'A' to 'B' at (x, y)` - When edit completes
   - `📋 COPY SUCCESS: Copied 'text'` - When copy works
   - `📋 PASTE SUCCESS: Pasted n characters` - When paste works

## Run and Test

```bash
cargo run
```

1. Load a PDF and click PROCESS
2. Go to Matrix tab
3. Click on a cell
4. Type any character - should update immediately!
5. Watch the terminal for debug messages
6. Check the debug panel at bottom for logged edits

## What to Watch For

Terminal Output:
- `📝 Text event: 'a'` - Key detected
- `🔤 TYPED 'a' at cell (5, 10)` - Character typed
- `✏️ EDIT SUCCESS: Changed ' ' to 'a' at (5, 10)` - Edit completed

Debug Panel:
- Shows recent edits in the log
- Updates in real-time

The text editing should now work properly with direct character replacement!
