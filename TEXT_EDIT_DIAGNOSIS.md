# Text Edit Feature Diagnosis

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED Components:

1. **Modal Dialog UI** (lines 4577-4654)
   - Window with text input field
   - Apply/Cancel buttons
   - Enter/Escape key handling
   - Auto-focus on text field

2. **Keyboard Event Handling** (lines 4131-4235)
   - Text input detection (lines 4135-4149)
   - Enter key handling (lines 4208-4213)
   - Arrow keys, Delete, Tab, Escape

3. **State Variables** (lines 2010-2014)
   - `text_edit_mode: bool` - Controls dialog visibility
   - `text_edit_content: String` - Text in dialog
   - `text_edit_position: Option<(usize, usize)>` - Cell being edited

4. **Visual Indicators**
   - Matrix tab shows ⌨️ when ready for input
   - Matrix tab shows ✏️ when edit mode active
   - Log messages for debugging

## Debugging Steps

1. **Run the app**: `cargo run`
2. **Load a PDF and process it**
3. **Click on the Matrix tab**
4. **Look for these indicators**:
   - Tab should show: `[MATRIX] ⌨️` (keyboard ready)
   - Log should show: `🎯 Matrix view focused`
5. **Click on a cell**
   - Log should show: `🖱️ Cell (x, y) selected`
6. **Type a character**
   - Tab should change to: `[MATRIX] ⌨️ ✏️`
   - Log should show: `📝 Opening text edit dialog...`
   - Modal dialog should appear

## Potential Issues

### If dialog doesn't appear:
1. **Focus Issue**: Matrix view might not have keyboard focus
   - Fix: Click inside the matrix area
   
2. **Event Consumption**: Other handlers might be consuming events
   - Check: Global shortcuts are disabled when matrix focused
   
3. **Cell Selection**: No cell might be selected
   - Fix: Click on a cell first

### The Code Flow:
```
User types character
  → ctx.input() detects Event::Text
  → Check if matrix focused & cell selected
  → Set text_edit_mode = true
  → Set text_edit_content = typed character
  → Next frame: Dialog renders
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Basic test
./verify_text_edit.sh

# Diagnostic with logging
./diagnose_text_edit.sh

# Debug with filtered output
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run 2>&1 | grep -E "(focus|selected|edit|dialog)"
```

## Next Steps

If the dialog still doesn't appear:
1. Add println! debugging in the event handler
2. Check if ctx.input() is receiving events at all
3. Verify the dialog render code is being reached
4. Test with a simpler egui example to isolate the issue
